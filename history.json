Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man.", "timestamp": "2024-06-17 23:40:15"}, {"video_id": "lUzpK0tGFcE", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUzpK0tGFcE", "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nThis video showcases

Soundproofed ceiling and hundreds of sprinklers for safety\n    * Ten thousand dollars in empty ", "transcript": " this is mr beast and he has just invited me to his top secret youtube warehouse well actually we're currently inside of it and i want to show you guys around so he can get views we're going to show you where his videos are filmed how his videos are edited and then finally how much a ridiculous setup like this actually costs and i'm a little scared because i've never shown anyone around this studio this is gonna be a first time this is gonna be cool come in here is around 50 000 square feet there's no polls or anything so we can just build sets we can do whatever we want you know what's blowing my mind this is not what i associate with youtube you know what's funny that's literally what everyone says when they come in here they're like for youtube one thing i noticed immediately when i walked in is like you clap you hear nothing back yeah except these guys in the back yeah they're working on a video that's exactly right so we soundproof the ceiling on top of that uh you'll probably notice there's hundreds of sprinklers on the ceiling do you have sprinklers because you keep blowing stuff up in here yeah exactly no you could blow up a car there and not have to worry about burning them in the building that's a rare use case scenario in one of our coming up video we need a million dollars these are empty don't try to rob me right now so we're putting ten thousand dollars in a hundred briefcases is there a reason you've settled on this particular model of briefcase does this just not look like ten thousand dollars i don't know it could be maybe more golden [Laughter] okay time to ask jimmy the big question android or iphone obviously iphone steve jobs steve jobs name the person who created android andy rubin okay well i didn't know that we'll keep a tally of every single person we meet in this tour this right here is one of our coming up videos the beauty of having all this space is our old warehouse was basically the size of this room this room feels like there was some havoc yeah there's a lot of havoc there's just like random broken bits of tech and eggs yeah so you should remember that if you show anything bad i'm gonna get egged that was a threat oh you're gonna break tech in front of me yeah yeah i will this was our little hub over here that you would have thought was baller so this is what it looked like when we were filming so you could see all the girls cameras there all the boys cameras there so we could constantly monitor it this is the kind of stuff we don't normally show we had to have six or seven people here monitoring every angle because if they just touch the red line they're out you have to basically set up like 40 cameras so you can monitor every single inch of the line what they're doing on top of content and there's two of them it's a role you don't think about yeah what did you do today i stared at girls for a hundred hours like you might want to refreeze i stared at a red line for a hundred dollars someone's getting a little edgy over here yeah and on top of that you can zoom in as well so we have tons of shots but just zooming into their mouths or whatever they're eating food oh my god like what kind of zoom level do you want to go to the camera room yeah okay james he's curious do you use iphone or android oh two to zero two zeros steve jobs wrapped around the studio is tons of office space multiple floors you'll just see like these are some people planning our next video is that room called boobs i didn't do it all right so this is the camera room yes some videos we use 100 cameras some videos we use 10 some we need to be able to zoom in 100x something we need a hundred vlog cameras for hide and seek there's a lot of weird things in here you want to summon tariq by some of them you're summoning them hey what's up this transition is going to suck this is tariq he's had a camera hello he's going to show us what's going on here i've never seen so much camera gear in my entire life we have 26 fs5s these are the time-lapse cameras that you guys see so every time you see a time-lapse shot this camera is usually hanging somewhere on set capturing it okay what just to give you guys an idea the fs5 was a six thousand dollar camera when it was launched in 2015. these guys have 26 of them five kids 26. let's do the math yeah the total is a lot and then you've got loads of the same lens so the way it works is every single camera lens has a focal length which basically just indicates how zoomed in it is our videos relative to these are very homegrown we film most of them in my bedroom the widest angle we have is like 24 mil and the most telescopic one we have is like a 55mm but these guys when they go wide they go wide this is a 10 millimeter lens which is used to capture the entirety of a massive video set in one shot and then when they want to get close-ups from further away they have a lens here capable of not 50 millimeters or 80 millimeters but 300 millimeters this is a telescope but there's three more key cameras that the mysteries team uses the first being the sony 4k camcorder so we usually use these for run and gun videos slash when we have a lot of night time shots and that's because it has not just actual night vision but also just insane optical image stabilization look how much the lens moves on the inside and then to top it all off there's about 50 gopro cameras in these boxes here and another 50 of what are effectively super high-end security cameras each capable of streaming a live view of their feed so that people in that control center can keep an eye on the video contestants in real time oh and also they have 20 times optical zoom and then the pista resistance this is an fvv drone that looks like you've made it we have an fpv pilot you build this you built it yeah it's actually wild that's something that someone has built themselves is a big part of your filming gear i'm putting you on the spot here all right can you guess the total value of tech in this room i'm about to be so wrong 1.3 million sweet it's been great thank you so much man oh and thank god i'm back tariq sucks i won't leave again i kind of missed you jimmy oh my gosh we're missing a lot of our play buttons we do our videos in tons of languages this is just our english channels this is mr b6 000 so what point did you change it in between 100k and a million apparently but anyways this is missing a lot don't look at it it's ugly do you have iphone or android i don't know which one i have android are you using oh wait so that's one for android one for android you use iphone well i guess a point for both it's 2022 and if you're still buying white boards you are an idiot there's a thing called whiteboard paint you can just draw wherever it doesn't matter it comes off so for us any note that we make we make it a thing to keep it digital you want to keep it online so that anyone can kind of log in and check it do you guys not care about that no no we're wall drawers i grab a water no he took it anyways this is an enormous screen when we got this place someone was like yeah we got free tvs and that was all i was told i don't even shout out to sony get your marketing budget on this it turns out jimmy's free tvs that you find all around this building they're actually sony's new 85-inch 8k hdr smart tvs and they're being used to watch 1080p content fantastic very comfortable that's an ipad holder yeah but does anyone actually use this you tell me and while he's getting comfortable we're going to continue the tour we don't need them what is this for like in the middle of a meeting is someone just going to be like sorry guys hey we're doing a tour i don't mind wait it's too comfortable no no it doesn't what i can't get in were you struggling to get inside that room all you gotta do is just that it picks up the bluetooth on my phone and it recognizes it's me so i can unlock the door so yeah this is my little apartment this is where i live for the most part so you actually sleep in your office of course this is my bed looks like my girlfriend left me a message yes if you want to sleep in my bed i won't stop you okay this is nice okay so in jimmy's fridge yogurt and water what we're potentially launching our own sauce at cheeseburger blur what's on it so they don't get the ingredients the only thing you have to eat them with is yogurt the worst part of my tiny apartment is uh the fridge blocks the tv i'm running out of room i missed that this is an enormous screen but it's above the couch so i don't use it these are all my clothes over here bathroom talk oh really even my bathroom's not off limits bro really we're about to just film the bathroom together so this is a heated toilet seat i'm telling you it will change your life get a heated toilet seat it will make your butt feel great josh yeah he's getting b-roll with my toilet this is kind of my morning routine i get out of bed i walk over here work out and i walk over here i shower and i walk over here i change and i walk over here and i eat it's like a little morning circuit and then i walk out there and i work and right over here is one of the cool rooms we also have a gaming channel and a react channel which we film in here iphone or android on three hold up what phone you use okay it's three well you have two why they're both iphones let's go nevermind good anyways we're actually here to show them the react set so come on in over here so this is where we film all our reacts videos let's react to some tech content let's see it you got to see the best tech video of all time is this like 360 camera wait josh what's going on here we go to video two no it just looks like it was rendered weird was this supposed to happen what is going on is that your cat's bum that's milo nice to meet you milo's butthole oh i know this video this is one of my favorite visions of the future these calendars here oh my gosh you can walk up to it like that so it knows what part of the room you are i love this idea this digital overlay on the real world i do too honestly i'm kind of pissed off we don't already have this could you see yourself using like all this kind of stuff 100 i mean i don't know how to ride a bike so not this i'm just thinking about like pokemon go too oh all right now we're on to our next clip with tesla there's no elon i'm disliking this is some very brave piloting yeah oh my gosh isn't it a tesla the safest car ever made in history remember it survived a crash test and actually broke the crash test dummy do you see teslas as like an art form i just like obviously that they don't run on fossil fuels faster than other cars it has more like amenities but i don't really use any of that the biggest pull to me for tesla is the interior like you sit down you feel like you're being of course if you're a car guy i'm just not who's this guy oh this i need yeah that looks very cool you like sushi right i do no screw this frick roll i don't care that was actually genius i'm calling someone to order them i know you were trying to prank us but i don't care wait i'm buying them hey i need some uh auto stick chopsticks love you you don't probably get much experience with android vents never this is the xiaomi 12s ultra one of its big selling points is the fact that it has the biggest camera sensor and a phone wow this is cool yeah this is crazy love it yeah the coloring's good look at that tell me that doesn't look like a wallpaper i can't say it's better but i can tell you it's how it works it's an interesting take because normally iphone users just kind of shut down android phones and for coming out to beast react studio you get a giant lot of money here you go thanks for coming out all right let's continue the tour android or iphone yes two more android points i hate you guys and this room over here i think you guys will enjoy so it's top secret but i'll let you in right in the back corner of the building of all the rooms in the building i feel like you would appreciate this the most all right so this is the mrb server room the way these guys have set it up is that all the projects that they're ever working on are stored right here on site in this server which means that every single computer in this entire complex is accessing the same set of files at the same time but the cherry on top is that it's configured so that even if you're sitting on the other side of the world you can actually remotely log in and access the editing machines here to use them to edit footage that's stored right here in this server so how much storage would you say you have in this room infinite what do you think the total cost of this room is 400 grand do you use android or iphone you play chess i do play chess on a game of chess now over the few days that i spent with jimmy the one key thing that i've learned about this guy is he takes board games seriously he absolutely came to me in a game of katan the night before chess was my way of making sure i won one back oh my god that was a girl game all right so this is the editing room and i had two things that i wanted to find out here one how fast is mr beast internet oh i see you know what i mean yeah what what upload this you know with footage finding stuff and two if these guys have any special gear to edit with yeah they kind of do the editors who prefer windows they'll be choosing 19 000 hp workstations with 24 core server grade processors and 256 gigabytes of ram and for those who prefer mac a pretty equivalent expect one thousand dollar mac pro wait that's how much they cost yeah feels like we've been in a lot of rooms but this is only part of it there's so many rooms in this building and it's so massive that's what i love about it i feel like i'm getting my steps in and over here is the little kitchen there's festival bars over here you should be eating this it's a very colorful selection of beverages you've never seen unicorn magic honeydew soda it was in there because it was a punishment for a video we don't obviously drink this it's actually really nice yeah so much sugar that i'm literally tearing up so i have an editing question for you actually you've got the most ridiculous camera gear available to you you've got 300 cameras in some videos you just upgraded your cameras actually to new ones that can shoot 8k resolution which i never will because i think it looks too professional yeah so this is the question why is it that after all that you still export in 1080p i don't like the way high quality footage looks you know at the end of the day it's just me and the boys messing around you know we still come up with the videos it's still things that i find fun and i enjoy and i don't ever want things to feel too produced why do you do 8k we do 4k to some extent in the tech genre there's like an expectation that you have good production value of course if i can't take good footage who am i to judge other phones for how good they listen 4k this is in 4k okay but there's a twist here you've come here thinking that jimmy has just one studio he actually has two we've just seen what they call studio c okay and this is studio a this is where it all began this is also where i've heard a lot of mystery secrets are and this is walt hi i'm walt i'm the head of on-site production for mr b's gaming and mr beast reacts there's a whole bunch of lights here yep what lights does mr beast use for his videos they're called sky panels every single one is a seven thousand dollar fixture i'm capable of lighting an entire warehouse on its own honestly that's like at least 10 12 kilos probably [Laughter] now because studio c is becoming the main office that everyone works out of studio a is the one where you find the most exotic items i'm talking like a mini drivable lamborghini giant fake marshmallows from when they tried to recreate willy wonka's chocolate factory and then tubs upon tubs of costumes that they used in their recreation of the squid games so this is the gaming trailer oh yeah iphone or android i am iphone i got a 12 pro max this cabin which is a part of studio a is where the entirety of the mr beast gaming channel is filmed and it's kind of nerd paradise the shelves upon shelves of wonderful and questionable tech items there's a real ice cream machine and there's nerf guns everywhere but then we go deeper inside so this is the office where i kind of currently work out of is this what i think it is yeah it was the retro future the custom made original game boy wow the logo the sesame seeds the pink power button you can change the color on the screen it has that authentic that is wild you can't beat it weirdly that's one of the coolest pieces of tech i've seen so far here we have jimmy's gaming room the main idea with these setups is that they could sit down and then be good to go filming within a minute or two i'm gonna sit down and i'm gonna rate mr b's gaming setup oh good choice of chair you can tell that the entire setup here is just geared around efficiency they've got it to the point that with one tap of this button here all lights can be turned on and off and with the top of this button all the relevant programs that they need to film one of these gaming videos they are loaded and ready in one go including the software to be able to see your own camera view in real time the mouse is really smooth this is the most responsive windows experience i've ever had the keyboard is a membrane keyboard which is normally considered like a tier below but you've done that for noise really yeah intentionally and so given that it's actually actually really nice to type on it doesn't feel bad the keys have nice travel he's done a definite solid with this controller this is my favorite looking xbox controller ever the chrome outlines around each button are nice this is a very good choice of mic and if you're wondering what the pc is that mr beast uses for gaming with an i9 11 900k 32 gigs of ram and an rtx 3090 graphics card hooked up to a 4k 120hz monitor this whole setup would be around 15 000 but that's not the crazy part because there isn't just one of them the entire room has actually been almost 100 cloned four times one for each of the characters in jimmy's videos chandler carl and chris they all have slightly different chairs and keyboards based on their preferences but the core machines behind it are one-to-one so this is the storage worker this is the storage of our house i've been told this is the weirdest place yes you need giant 40-inch touchscreen iphones got those yeah so as you can tell i'm very heavily on to team iphone so this giant iphone it's essentially a real iphone 6s that's casting its screen to an apple tv box screwed into the back that's hooked up to a large tv screen it sounds ridiculous but it works this is wild this is like the one part of it that i i wouldn't have thought actually works yeah i could take a portrait mode all right let's do that yeah i got it i got you i got you there we go there you go left my mark this storage center is just rammed with all the stuff that's been used in past videos that might need to be used in future videos literally anything you can think of tiki torches rubber chickens an even bigger nano leaf light collection then we have even a box full of shockingly realistic babies don't ask me why it's here pretty much all the expensive stuff lies within here as far as like phones to give away it's always apple i think you're just broken i'll scare you a little bit i'm sorry and to wrap up the studio tour i wanted to show him something cool so walk with me boys oh there's a plant there we're doing a video where i put a guy inside of this red circle see that outline around the house and if he survives in there for 100 days straight he wins half a million dollars okay so we've seen studio c we've seen studio a we've seen whatever this is we've got the full price of all the tech inside what is the actual cost of the buildings themselves oh boy the big studio over there was a little over 10 million dollars the old one actually was a church that we renovated that was like probably 1.3 million so okay 11.3 million dollars in buildings yeah everything i don't even want to know the total you know what i just make the best videos possible and sometimes i have to spend money and if you enjoyed this video then a sub to the channel would be he told me to say beastly you might have noticed over the last few months that the entire way that i'm trying to make my videos is changing the way i spend much more time moving between locations and being out and about the way i'm trying to get more interactions with youtube friends and members of the public and how i'm trying to have a clear golden moment in every video a culmination of everything that rewards you the viewer for clicking a lot of this stuff has come from the storytelling through film course that i found on skillshare by a guy called thomas de gea and the thing that really struck me about this is how efficiently you can learn stuff on this platform there's no clickbait there's no ads and it's organized in such a way that you can pick up any new skill in practically any category from animation to marketing start to finish in 30 minutes the first thousand of you to sign up using my code or the link in

courses with a prize of $800,000.\n\n**Obstacle Course 1:**\n\n* Involved jumping across swinging hammers and balancing on a platform 200 feet in the air.\n* Mack successfully completed it.\n\n**Obstacle Course 2:**\n\n* Consisted of a monkey bar", "transcript": " I have built the most\ndeadly obstacle course in the world, and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it\nwithout falling 200 feet to the ground. Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man.", "timestamp": "2024-06-18 12:56:17"}, {"video_id": "PWirijQkH4M&t", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWirijQkH4M&t=5s", "summary": "**Summary of \"The Deadliest Obstacle Course in the World\" Video**\n\n**Introduction:**\n\n* Jimmy Donaldson, the video creator, has constructed the world's most perilous obstacle course, which his friend Mack attempts to complete without plummeting 200 feet.\n\n**Obstacle Course 1:**\n\n* Mack jumps across swinging platforms while blindfolded, securing a $800,000 prize if", "transcript": " I have built the most\ndeadly obstacle course in the world, and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it\nwithout falling 200 feet to the ground. Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000.

Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000.

Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man.", "timestamp": "2024-06-18 13:41:30"}, {"video_id": "PWirijQkH4M&t", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWirijQkH4M&t=5s", "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nJimmy Donaldson, known as MrBeast, created the most dangerous obstacle course ever, challenging his friend Mack to complete it for a pri", "transcript": " I have built the most\ndeadly obstacle course in the world, and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it\nwithout falling 200 feet to the ground.

This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor.

It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man.", "timestamp": "2024-06-18 13:44:52"}, {"video_id": "PWirijQkH4M&t", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWirijQkH4M&t=5s", "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nJimmy, the host, has constructed the world's most dangerous obstacle course, and his friend Mack attempts to conquer it for a chance to win $800,000.\n\n**Obstcle Course Summary:**\n\n**Level 1:** Jumping across swinging hamm", "transcript": " I have built the most\ndeadly obstacle course in the world, and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it\nwithout falling 200 feet to the ground. Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man.", "timestamp": "2024-06-19 18:40:10"}, {"video_id": "PWirijQkH4M&t", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWirijQkH4M&t=5s", "summary": "**Summary of the Obstacle Course Challenge**\n\nJimmy creates a series of six obstacle courses for his friend Mack, with a prize of $800,000 for completing them all. Each course is designed to test different abilities, including balance, strength, and mental agility.\n\n**Obstacle Course 1: Skywalk**\n\nMack must navigate a platform high in the air, avoiding swinging hammers. He successfully completes the course.\n\n**Obstacle Course 2: Monkey Bars**\n\nMack must choose between climbing monkey bars or balancing on a beam. He chooses the monkey bars and falls twice before completing the course with the help of Jimmy's encouragement.\n\n**Obstacle Course 3: Memory Maze**\n\nMack must memorize a pattern of tiles and cross a floor without stepping on any red tiles. After several failed attempts, he eventually completes the course by taking his time and checking the pattern repeatedly.\n\n**", "transcript": " I have built the most\ndeadly obstacle course in the world, and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it\nwithout falling 200 feet to the ground. Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man.", "timestamp": "2024-06-19 18:49:07"}, {"video_id": "PWirijQkH4M&t", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWirijQkH4M&t=5s", "summary": "**Summary**\n\nYouTuber Jimmy Donaldson (MrBeast) hosts an obstacle course competition where contestant Mack attempts to win $800,000 by completing six deadly courses.\n\n**Course 1:**\n\n* Mack navigates a high platform and swinging hammers, ultimately jumping to a platform 200 feet in the air.\n\n**Course 2:**\n\n* Mack chooses monkey bars over a ba", "transcript": " I have built the most\ndeadly obstacle course in the world, and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it\nwithout falling 200 feet to the ground. Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000.

And for every trap this contestant\nsurvives, he wins $100,000. But if he fails one,\nhe loses everything. The first trap is simple. He's got to break out of this cage and climb up this roof\nbefore the walls close in. - Mack, are you ready?\n- I'm ready. - You sure?\n- Do it. That was a little rude, but okay. How am I supposed to get out of this. Mack, hey, you want a hit? What? The roof Hey Mack,\ndon't forget a $100,000 is on the line. Oh, my gosh. It's getting so close to the spikes. How does breaking the chair help? Mack, come on. I\u2019m trying, Jimmy, shut up. The wall is almost there. Mack, hurry. Mack, come on. Hurrry! Come on, come on, come on. You just won a hundred grand! Yeah! - But...\n- Yes! But I have a second trap\nset up for you right now. And if you risk this\nhundred grand, you could win 200 grand. Think on it But I also don't have a video\nif you don't say yes. I'm doing it. Let's go.\nMack may sound confident now, but there are ten more traps\nhe has to get through if he wants to walk out of this\nwith $1,000,000. But first, let's see if he can win\n200 grand. Welcome to Trap number two. Close the door. Glad we were not under that.\nIn these duffel bags. It's 200 grand in cash. All you have to do to win it, is press that red button\nand go back to this door. What happens when I press the button? Just press it and find out. You wanna come with me? Oh, no. I'm staying,\nI'm staying over here. - Come with me.\n- Go press the button. In case you forgot 200 grand is on the line. I don't know what's going to happen\nwhen I push the button. Just press the button The dramatic lights. I think you can see what the trap is. If you touch a laser,\nthe door is going to slam closed. Is there a time limit? There's a touch of the laser\nlimit and it's one. Bro, imagine if he just hit the first\nlaser. This is not made for short people dude. Oh my gosh. I had a feeling\nhe would crawl on the floor. That's why coming up, There's lasers\nliterally straight in front of him. I don't know how\nI'm going to get past those. - I'm gonna be honest.\n- Oh, this is crazy. Oh my gosh. Oh, you're like,\nsurrounded by lasers. Mack, I wouldn't move. Jimmy, if I touch the laser. How long do I have\nbefore that door closes? Less than a second. Take a step to your left. Take a step out of the way. - Okay.\n- Thank you. Three, two, one. Oh my gosh. That was so... I'm speechless. Oh, yeah. - Let's go!\n- Don't celebrate yet. Do you want to walk away with 200\ngrand or risk it for 300 grand? I think I want to\ndo the next one. Let's do it. Unfortunately for Mack,\nall of these traps get progressively harder and harder to pass,\nespecially this next one. Mack, come on in. You're now in trap number three. Bro, look how cool this is. We literally spent the last 60 days\ndesigning this set. This is the $200,000\nyou've already won. All you have to do here is grab the next hundred thousand dollars,\nand then all you got to do is walk down this path and walk\nright through this door. What's going to happen\nwhen I grab the money? - Look around.\n- It's over your head on this one. Okay. Starting to click for me\na little bit. That was a little too obvious. I'd say as soon as I picked up money that boulder's coming straight for me. And if you get ran over by the\nboulder, I take my 300 grand back. Oh, dude I'm going to go over here so I don't get\nsquished by a boulder. I want you to count me down\nfor three. Three, two, one. Go! Oh, my God. Go, go, go You got to go. Go, go, go. Back off! Not going to lie You are much faster than I thought. Oh, my gosh. That boulder was right behind him. Are you going to go for a fourth? I don't know, Jim. You're actually getting better. If that thing hit me,\nwhat would happen? Would I die? Well, here's what happened to Nolan\nwhen he got hit. It hurts. - I'm sorry, I just got to...\n- Yeah, of course. No, this is a big decision.\nYou should really think it through. Okay, so what do you do? - Okay, I'll do one more.\n- One more? - One more, yeah.\n- All right. Let's go see if\nhe loses 300 grand...  or makes more money. Don't phrase it like that, Jimmy. Mack is now in a ball. How's it feel? I'm realizing\nhow bad I smell in this ball. You chose this. Open the door. Welcome to trap number four. For this trap, I made a life sized\nvideo game that he has to complete. Oh my gosh, dude. To win 400 grand, all Mack needs to do\nis complete this course. In case it's not clear If you fall down there in the foam,\nyou lose. I see that. Oh, yeah. One more thing. You only have 5 minutes\nto complete the course. Okay. First things first. We have these little platforms. Not too crazy. This is so much harder in a ball. Bro, if he's unironically\nstruggling with this, Wait until he gets to all the moving\nplatforms of death. This is not going to be easy, Oh my gosh, dude. Jump! Jump? Mack, be careful. 400 grand on the line. Here, can I join you? - Why? why?\n- I don't know. - Why?\n- I'm sorry. Because I want to be in the video. It's my video. This is terrifying Up to this point, it's been pretty easy. This is where it starts to get difficult. This is where it's difficult? It has not been easy. Oh, this is crazy, dude. Unlike the other challenges. He's actually going pretty quick. Balancing inside of this\nball is harder than it looks. It multiplies all of your movements,\nmeaning you can fall at any time. This ball is so hard to balance in. Bro, it's 400 grand. It's not supposed to be easy. The obstacle so far in this trap are\nnothing compared to the final stage. This is where it gets really hard. I couldn't have been more wrong. Mack literally obliterated the last stage of this course\nin 10 seconds. Oh my God! That is what I'm talking about! bro, whenever he wins,\nI get afraid to be around him. I don't know what to say when\nI sketch this on a piece of paper. It seemed a lot harder. However, the traps that follow this one\nare harder than anything we've seen so far. Answer the riddle. What is better than 400 grand? 500 grand? Are you going to be a wuss or\ndo you want a chance to win $500,000? If the next one is going to be\nas easy as this, let's run it back. I didn't say it would,\nbut I'm going to take that as a yes. Next trap. Which Mack is going to need\na bathing suit for because... It might involve some swimming. Jimmy, what is this? Mack, hop in this water real quick. Mack, do you have\nany idea what you're doing? Not really. Okay. This trap is hard, but simple. When I say go, your money will be\npulled towards that massive bonfire.  To stop it\nYou need to pull that lever. And to get there, you'll have to swim\nthrough this underwater chamber and pick the locks of all four doors\nin your path. Got it. You're probably wondering,\nwhy am I holding a clothes hanger? Because that's\nhow you pick the locks. - Mack, are you ready?\n- I'm ready! Three, two. Oh, wait, Mack,\ncould you fix that thing behind you? All right, the timer has started. This money in exactly 3 minutes,\nit's going to be in that fire pit. Unless Mack comes out the other end,\nand flips that lever. He's struggling right now. How is he holding his\nbreath this long? So Mack just unlocked the first lock. You got this, Mack. And while he's competing\nfor half a million dollars, I want to tell you about\nStumble Guys. A free to play multiplayer game\nwhere you basically compete against random people\nin knockout games and whoever comes out on top wins\nthe crown. Every time Mack unlocks the lock,\nhe goes deeper and deeper into the water, which means he has less and less time to pick his locks as he has to\ncome back up to the surface for air. That is so hard to see. Bro, this is crazy.  Stumble Guys even took\nsome of our biggest videos and turned them into levels\nin the actual game. And on top of that, Stumble Guys\nnow has MrBeast skins, emotes and even victory animations\navailable inside their item shop. He got the third door open. There's also a special MrBeast-themed event\ncoming soon on Stumble Guys, so make sure you download an iOS,\nAndroid or Steam for free right now. All right, Mack. One more door. Bye bye. Look how close the money is\nto the fire. He is almost done,\nI think he just opened the fourth gate. Pull the lever. You got to pull the lever! You just stopped the money! Oh, my gosh. I hate you. You might be a little lightheaded from\nthe lack of oxygen. I could barely see. I know, see that 500 grand\nfloating right there? Do you want to risk it for 600 grand? Full transparency. The next trap. It's probably the easiest trap\nof all. I'm serious. If you were to ever stop,\nI don't think now is when you would want to stop. - All right, let's do it. I'm in.\n- Yeah? - Yeah yeah, let's go.\n- That could have been a lie. What? I was, in fact, not lying. Anyone with a developed prefrontal cortex should be able to pass this next one. Welcome to the next trap. This, in theory, should be the\neasiest 100 grand of your life. Okay, I need you to pick either\na Feastables Bar or a Hershey's bar One needs to go in the trash - There we go!\n- Yeah! I will never eat that. - Disgusting!\n- Well of course... Cause you just won\na hundred grand. That's right. Now you have $600,000 in cash. - Jimmy that's six lamborghinis\n- And a Feastable bar. I'll throw that in. Thanks. Do you want to risk this $600,000 Mini ocean of money For the chance to win $700,000? You're crazy. I can tell he's about to say yes. I don\u2019t know\u2026 Dude, my mom is gonna be so mad\nat me if I lose this right now. Yes or no? Just one more. What's one more? - All right, let's do it. Yes.\n- All right. One more. I actually though. Please do not let me do\none after that. - Okay.\n- Okay. Well, where we're going on this next trap, Mack is going to need a blindfold. All right, can you see? I cannot see. That was a lie. All right,\nmaybe actually two blindfolds. I hope he's not scared of heights. And if you're wondering\nwhy I said up heights earlier... Well... Send us up! Oh, we're going up. No, no, no, no, no. Mack may know that we're going up,\nbut not how far Oh my God, dude. We're going 200\nfeet in the air, where he's going to have\nto face his biggest fear If he wants to walk away with 700\ngrand Mack... let's take off the trash can. Heads up! Mack... Welcome to the next trap. I hope you're not afraid of heights. I'm scared, bro. Dude, that looks terrifying. The next trap is simple. All you have to do is walk\nto the other side on this absurdly thin balance beam. Okay, this is insane.\nOh, my gosh. I just don't know how\nhe's going to do this. I'm so scared right now.  I'm so scared. Bro, this is terrifying. - I don't... Would you do this?\n- Oh, heck no. I would never do this. 700 grand down the line. His worst fear. Let's see what happens. Okay. I can't think about anymore. It is what it is. There. Oh, he's definitely\nat the point of no return. Karl, don't move... Oh my gosh. Holy crap. He\u2019s making it\u2026 Oh! No way. Yeah! - Yes!\n- Yes! - Yes!\n- Oh my God! That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about, baby. Oh my God, dude. Based on the first couple of steps,\nI did not think he was going to make it As requested, I will not try to influence you. Do you want to walk away\nwith your 700 grand or risk it and keep going for\nthe million dollars your decision? I have the opportunity right now to\nleave with just an insane amount of money. But... I'm just... I'm just so close. I just feel like everyone at home\nwants to see the next three challenges,\nright? I do. Final answer. I'm going to the next one. Yeah! If he fails the next trap, I'm going to feel terrible. Mack now only has three traps remaining to win $1,000,000,\nbut it only gets harder from here. You decide to risk the money. - Let's do this.\n- I'm so scared. Lights on! This next\ntrap may look a little familiar Our most viewed video is Squid Game So I thought it would be fun\nif we combined the glass bridge game with the cookie cutting game\nall into one trap. Just like in Squid Game,\nyou have a honeycomb here. You have to cut out the shape\nthat's there and put that exact shape on the scanner. If you break the cookie, it won't fit in the circle\nand the bridge will drop you. And I lose everything. But if it's the exact same size,\nthe door will open and you have to do it three more times How much time to have? There is no time limit. - Thank God.\n- No, but you've been... - Thank God! Some of these challenges, he takes an hour. so I might give you one. - No, don't give me a time limit.\n- Okay, well, can you just at least start? Okay. A strategy. Jimmy,\nis I lick this boy. And that's going to melt the sugar. And then ideally, I can poke this\nneedle through this cookie. So your strategy is Squid Games. That's the way to put it.\nYeah. - Mack.\n- Get away from me. - I didn't touch you.\n- You need to stay over there. What about my croc? No. Well, now I don't have a shoe. It's the only way to teach you, man. All right, here we go. It's taking forever. I understand that this money\nis essentially meaningless to you. Me? This will change my life. So I'm going to take my sweet time\ncutting the circle out. You can take your sweet time.\nTake your sweet time Just the next one. I'm probably going put a time limit. No! Halfway done. That's it, right? Okay, put it there. You're good. Light's on. He's going to solve the triangle\npretty easily. But after the triangle is a star\nand an umbrella which are way harder. Okay.  Cookie. Also, wait, wait. Before you open it. One second. Oh, no, I'll replace that because the money\nwas so far away I moved it over here. In case you forgot what you're\ncompeting for. - Part of it's really far away.\n- I will replace it. Okay. You can proceed. For the record,\nI regret saying yes to this. - Really?\n- Yeah. At this point see how sad you are\nat the thought of losing? I would actually highly recommend\nif you win to walk away after this. That's what I thought after\nI finished the high ropes course. That's what you thought after every trap, But yet, we're here. Wow, that's just sliding off. Last piece. Oh my gosh. I think he did it. Okay. Walk on in here. Cookie us. Now comes the real challenge.\nUmbrella. The hardest shape. If I win this, I don't think\nI should risk it again, dude. All right, how about this? Cut this stupid umbrella out and then\njust take the money for my sanity. For my sanity, dude. Okay. Oh, and by the way,\nthis one has a ten minute timer. - Okay, it's ticking right now?\n- Yeah. 9 minutes and 50 seconds\nremain. I love you. I will not be speaking to you\nwhile I'm doing this. I completely understand $800,000 is on the line. Give me a dollarbill, like a stack money.\nGive it to me. Stack, okay. He's using the money as a hammer. They didn't do that in Squid Game. I've never felt more intensity\nin my life. This is very, very difficult. I don't know what I'm going to do\nwith myself if I lose this. 5 minutes remain. Honestly, I think you can do this. I feel like\nI'm going to break it, dude. Shoe hammer Dude, I'm just making no progress. 2 minutes. He's starting to break it off. He's starting to pull pieces of. Just so you know,\nthere's 60 seconds left Mack. Wait, what just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. And I had it all. It's $700,000. I don't know why I did\nthis. Would it have hurt less\nif you just lost the first challenge? So much less. Well, here, come on buddy. Come on. Let's stand up. Let it be known. If you're in a MrBeast video... quit while you're ahead. I'll be honest, guys. This was pretty sad. So I decided to give Mack an extra 100\ngrand for his troubles. Let me know if you want to see\nmore videos like this one. Hopefully\nthe next one has a happier ending.

We have these little platforms. Not too crazy. This is so much harder in a ball. Bro, if he's unironically\nstruggling with this, Wait until he gets to all the moving\nplatforms of death. This is not going to be easy, Oh my gosh, dude. Jump! Jump? Mack, be careful. 400 grand on the line. Here, can I join you? - Why? why?\n- I don't know. - Why?\n- I'm sorry. Because I want to be in the video. It's my video. This is terrifying Up to this point, it's been pretty easy. This is where it starts to get difficult. This is where it's difficult? It has not been easy. Oh, this is crazy, dude. Unlike the other challenges. He's actually going pretty quick. Balancing inside of this\nball is harder than it looks. It multiplies all of your movements,\nmeaning you can fall at any time. This ball is so hard to balance in. Bro, it's 400 grand. It's not supposed to be easy. The obstacle so far in this trap are\nnothing compared to the final stage. This is where it gets really hard. I couldn't have been more wrong. Mack literally obliterated the last stage of this course\nin 10 seconds. Oh my God! That is what I'm talking about! bro, whenever he wins,\nI get afraid to be around him. I don't know what to say when\nI sketch this on a piece of paper. It seemed a lot harder. However, the traps that follow this one\nare harder than anything we've seen so far. Answer the riddle. What is better than 400 grand? 500 grand? Are you going to be a wuss or\ndo you want a chance to win $500,000? If the next one is going to be\nas easy as this, let's run it back. I didn't say it would,\nbut I'm going to take that as a yes. Next trap. Which Mack is going to need\na bathing suit for because... It might involve some swimming. Jimmy, what is this? Mack, hop in this water real quick. Mack, do you have\nany idea what you're doing? Not really. Okay. This trap is hard, but simple. When I say go, your money will be\npulled towards that massive bonfire.  To stop it\nYou need to pull that lever. And to get there, you'll have to swim\nthrough this underwater chamber and pick the locks of all four doors\nin your path. Got it. You're probably wondering,\nwhy am I holding a clothes hanger? Because that's\nhow you pick the locks. - Mack, are you ready?\n- I'm ready! Three, two. Oh, wait, Mack,\ncould you fix that thing behind you? All right, the timer has started. This money in exactly 3 minutes,\nit's going to be in that fire pit. Unless Mack comes out the other end,\nand flips that lever. He's struggling right now. How is he holding his\nbreath this long? So Mack just unlocked the first lock. You got this, Mack. And while he's competing\nfor half a million dollars, I want to tell you about\nStumble Guys. A free to play multiplayer game\nwhere you basically compete against random people\nin knockout games and whoever comes out on top wins\nthe crown. Every time Mack unlocks the lock,\nhe goes deeper and deeper into the water, which means he has less and less time to pick his locks as he has to\ncome back up to the surface for air. That is so hard to see. Bro, this is crazy.  Stumble Guys even took\nsome of our biggest videos and turned them into levels\nin the actual game. And on top of that, Stumble Guys\nnow has MrBeast skins, emotes and even victory animations\navailable inside their item shop. He got the third door open. There's also a special MrBeast-themed event\ncoming soon on Stumble Guys, so make sure you download an iOS,\nAndroid or Steam for free right now. All right, Mack. One more door. Bye bye. Look how close the money is\nto the fire. He is almost done,\nI think he just opened the fourth gate. Pull the lever. You got to pull the lever! You just stopped the money! Oh, my gosh. I hate you. You might be a little lightheaded from\nthe lack of oxygen. I could barely see. I know, see that 500 grand\nfloating right there? Do you want to risk it for 600 grand? Full transparency. The next trap. It's probably the easiest trap\nof all. I'm serious. If you were to ever stop,\nI don't think now is when you would want to stop. - All right, let's do it. I'm in.\n- Yeah? - Yeah yeah, let's go.\n- That could have been a lie. What? I was, in fact, not lying. Anyone with a developed prefrontal cortex should be able to pass this next one. Welcome to the next trap. This, in theory, should be the\neasiest 100 grand of your life. Okay, I need you to pick either\na Feastables Bar or a Hershey's bar One needs to go in the trash - There we go!\n- Yeah! I will never eat that. - Disgusting!\n- Well of course... Cause you just won\na hundred grand. That's right. Now you have $600,000 in cash. - Jimmy that's six lamborghinis\n- And a Feastable bar. I'll throw that in. Thanks. Do you want to risk this $600,000 Mini ocean of money For the chance to win $700,000? You're crazy. I can tell he's about to say yes. I don\u2019t know\u2026 Dude, my mom is gonna be so mad\nat me if I lose this right now. Yes or no? Just one more. What's one more? - All right, let's do it. Yes.\n- All right. One more. I actually though. Please do not let me do\none after that. - Okay.\n- Okay. Well, where we're going on this next trap, Mack is going to need a blindfold. All right, can you see? I cannot see. That was a lie. All right,\nmaybe actually two blindfolds. I hope he's not scared of heights. And if you're wondering\nwhy I said up heights earlier... Well... Send us up! Oh, we're going up. No, no, no, no, no. Mack may know that we're going up,\nbut not how far Oh my God, dude. We're going 200\nfeet in the air, where he's going to have\nto face his biggest fear If he wants to walk away with 700\ngrand Mack... let's take off the trash can. Heads up! Mack... Welcome to the next trap. I hope you're not afraid of heights. I'm scared, bro. Dude, that looks terrifying. The next trap is simple. All you have to do is walk\nto the other side on this absurdly thin balance beam. Okay, this is insane.\nOh, my gosh. I just don't know how\nhe's going to do this. I'm so scared right now.  I'm so scared. Bro, this is terrifying. - I don't... Would you do this?\n- Oh, heck no. I would never do this. 700 grand down the line. His worst fear. Let's see what happens. Okay. I can't think about anymore. It is what it is. There. Oh, he's definitely\nat the point of no return. Karl, don't move... Oh my gosh. Holy crap. He\u2019s making it\u2026 Oh! No way. Yeah! - Yes!\n- Yes! - Yes!\n- Oh my God! That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about, baby. Oh my God, dude. Based on the first couple of steps,\nI did not think he was going to make it As requested, I will not try to influence you. Do you want to walk away\nwith your 700 grand or risk it and keep going for\nthe million dollars your decision? I have the opportunity right now to\nleave with just an insane amount of money. But... I'm just... I'm just so close. I just feel like everyone at home\nwants to see the next three challenges,\nright? I do. Final answer. I'm going to the next one. Yeah! If he fails the next trap, I'm going to feel terrible. Mack now only has three traps remaining to win $1,000,000,\nbut it only gets harder from here. You decide to risk the money. - Let's do this.\n- I'm so scared. Lights on! This next\ntrap may look a little familiar Our most viewed video is Squid Game So I thought it would be fun\nif we combined the glass bridge game with the cookie cutting game\nall into one trap. Just like in Squid Game,\nyou have a honeycomb here. You have to cut out the shape\nthat's there and put that exact shape on the scanner. If you break the cookie, it won't fit in the circle\nand the bridge will drop you. And I lose everything. But if it's the exact same size,\nthe door will open and you have to do it three more times How much time to have? There is no time limit. - Thank God.\n- No, but you've been... - Thank God! Some of these challenges, he takes an hour. so I might give you one. - No, don't give me a time limit.\n- Okay, well, can you just at least start? Okay. A strategy. Jimmy,\nis I lick this boy. And that's going to melt the sugar. And then ideally, I can poke this\nneedle through this cookie. So your strategy is Squid Games. That's the way to put it.\nYeah. - Mack.\n- Get away from me. - I didn't touch you.\n- You need to stay over there. What about my croc? No. Well, now I don't have a shoe. It's the only way to teach you, man. All right, here we go. It's taking forever. I understand that this money\nis essentially meaningless to you. Me? This will change my life. So I'm going to take my sweet time\ncutting the circle out. You can take your sweet time.\nTake your sweet time Just the next one. I'm probably going put a time limit. No! Halfway done. That's it, right? Okay, put it there. You're good. Light's on. He's going to solve the triangle\npretty easily. But after the triangle is a star\nand an umbrella which are way harder. Okay.  Cookie. Also, wait, wait. Before you open it. One second. Oh, no, I'll replace that because the money\nwas so far away I moved it over here. In case you forgot what you're\ncompeting for. - Part of it's really far away.\n- I will replace it. Okay. You can proceed. For the record,\nI regret saying yes to this. - Really?\n- Yeah. At this point see how sad you are\nat the thought of losing? I would actually highly recommend\nif you win to walk away after this. That's what I thought after\nI finished the high ropes course. That's what you thought after every trap, But yet, we're here. Wow, that's just sliding off. Last piece. Oh my gosh. I think he did it. Okay. Walk on in here. Cookie us. Now comes the real challenge.\nUmbrella. The hardest shape. If I win this, I don't think\nI should risk it again, dude. All right, how about this? Cut this stupid umbrella out and then\njust take the money for my sanity. For my sanity, dude. Okay. Oh, and by the way,\nthis one has a ten minute timer. - Okay, it's ticking right now?\n- Yeah. 9 minutes and 50 seconds\nremain. I love you. I will not be speaking to you\nwhile I'm doing this. I completely understand $800,000 is on the line. Give me a dollarbill, like a stack money.\nGive it to me. Stack, okay. He's using the money as a hammer. They didn't do that in Squid Game. I've never felt more intensity\nin my life. This is very, very difficult. I don't know what I'm going to do\nwith myself if I lose this. 5 minutes remain. Honestly, I think you can do this. I feel like\nI'm going to break it, dude. Shoe hammer Dude, I'm just making no progress. 2 minutes. He's starting to break it off. He's starting to pull pieces of. Just so you know,\nthere's 60 seconds left Mack. Wait, what just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. And I had it all. It's $700,000. I don't know why I did\nthis. Would it have hurt less\nif you just lost the first challenge? So much less. Well, here, come on buddy. Come on. Let's stand up. Let it be known. If you're in a MrBeast video... quit while you're ahead. I'll be honest, guys. This was pretty sad. So I decided to give Mack an extra 100\ngrand for his troubles. Let me know if you want to see\nmore videos like this one. Hopefully\nthe next one has a happier ending. See you later.", "timestamp": "2024-06-20 00:11:30"}, {"video_id": "PWirijQkH4M&t", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWirijQkH4M&t=5s", "summary": "## Deadly Obstacle Course\n**Level 1: High-Rise Jump**\n- Jump over double swinging hammers\n- Longest distance\n- 800k prize for completion\n\n**Level 2: Balance and Strength**\n- Choose between balance beam or monkey bars\n- 100ft free fall for failure\n- 800k prize for completion\n\n**Level 3: Memory Test**\n- Memorize a 44-tile floor pattern\n- Step on only green tiles\n- 30 minutes to memorize, 800k forfeit on explosion\n\n**Level 4: Wipeout Obstacles**\n- Roll log, climb obstacles, and balance on barrels\n- Use provided chocolate bar for multiple attempts\n- 800k prize for completion\n\n**Level 5: Rolling Logs in the Sky**\n- Cross three rolling logs at 200ft height\n- Eight bags of money to transfer\n- 800k prize for completion\n\n**Level 6: Extreme Course and Final Umbrella Cookie Challenge**\n- Wall of Death, giant swinging hammers, balance beam\n- Final jump on an umbrella cookie with trapeze bars in between\n- 200ft untethered free fall for failure\n- 800k prize for completion, umbrella cookie attempt optional\n\n**Results**\n- Mack successfully completed all six levels and won **$800,000**.\n- He chose to spend the money on his friends in need.", "transcript": " I have built the most\ndeadly obstacle course in the world, and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it\nwithout falling 200 feet to the ground. Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000.

Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000.

Even though I made a good\u00a0\u00a0 progress in the last 5 years and I am grateful\u00a0\nto be where I am today, there\u2019s a part of me\u00a0\u00a0 that still wonders if I could have done better.\u00a0\nYou see, I spent countless hours watching youtube\u00a0\u00a0 videos trying to figure out the best method to learn\u00a0\nprogramming in a way that not only gets me a job,\u00a0\u00a0 but also sets me up for a great career as a\u00a0\nSoftware Engineer. I could not find a single\u00a0\u00a0 comprehensive video that explained how to\u00a0\nlearn coding from scratch step by step. So,\u00a0\u00a0 I had to try out many different things that people\u00a0\nwere recommending on Youtube. As a result, I\u00a0\u00a0 started learning Python, Java, Javascript, React,\u00a0\nRedux all at once. After learning all this, when I\u00a0\u00a0 looked behind to check where I had reached, I was\u00a0\nin the exact same spot where I started: I was Jobless.\u00a0\u00a0 It took me many many months to climb out of that\u00a0\ndarkness. If only there was a video which gave me\u00a0\u00a0 all the steps I need to take to learn programming\u00a0\nin a practical way, I would not only be in the\u00a0\u00a0 exact same place as today in much less time,\u00a0\nI might have also become a better programmer.\u00a0\u00a0 What you\u2019re watching right now is the video I\u00a0\nwish I had when I started learning programming. Before I get into the 4 step process and give\u00a0\nyou all the free resources I would use to learn\u00a0\u00a0 programming, let\u2019s discuss what I would pick\u00a0\nfor my programming language. I want to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 3 popular options here. First and one of the most\u00a0\npopular options is Javascript. Though Javascript\u00a0\u00a0 is used in the backend with the help of Node,\u00a0\nmost of its demand still comes from the\u00a0\u00a0 front end. So, I am going to assume that if I were\u00a0\nto pick Javascript as my first language, I want to\u00a0\u00a0 do front end development. If you don\u2019t already\u00a0\nknow, HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the basic\u00a0\u00a0 building blocks of front end development. But,\u00a0\nthese 3 are not enough to become an employable\u00a0\u00a0 Software Engineer. You need to learn some more\u00a0\nlibraries or frameworks on top of these to be on\u00a0\u00a0 par with the industry. Some example frameworks for\u00a0\nCSS that I learnt are Bootstrap and Tailwind but\u00a0\u00a0 there are many other options. For Javascript, you\u00a0\nwill need to learn React, Angular or Vue to land a\u00a0\u00a0 job. There are some other advanced technologies\u00a0\nlike Redux and NextJS that might be needed in\u00a0\u00a0 some cases. As you might have already guessed,\u00a0\nthis path is long and hard for beginners. That\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 why I would not pick Javascript if I was just\u00a0\nstarting out. Next popular option is learning\u00a0\u00a0 Python which most people recommend. Python has\u00a0\nmany applications in backend, automation and\u00a0\u00a0 data science. Why most people recommend Python\u00a0\nis because it\u2019s one of the easiest language to learn.\u00a0\u00a0 Syntax of python is very simple and easy to pick.\u00a0\nPython will also give you an advantage in coding\u00a0\u00a0 interviews because it requires less lines of\u00a0\ncode for the same amount of code. Due to all these\u00a0\u00a0 advantages, I had recommended Python in my video\u00a0\non Fastest way to learn coding and get a job. But,\u00a0\u00a0 this video is not about taking shortcuts.\nWhat we need to understand is that all this\u00a0\u00a0 ease of learning comes at the cost of\u00a0\nperformance. I don\u2019t want to get into\u00a0\u00a0 too many details here but Python is slower than\u00a0\nother programming languages like Java or C++.\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s because it\u2019s dynamically typed and it\u2019s an\u00a0\ninterpreted language. If you don't know what that\u00a0\u00a0 is, that\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it. Just know\u00a0\nthat Python is slower. Another issue with Python\u00a0\u00a0 is that it has limited support for concurrency.\u00a0\nFor these reasons, Python is rarely used to\u00a0\u00a0 build complex backend systems. If I look at my own\u00a0\nexperience, most of Amazon's backend is written in\u00a0\u00a0 Java and most of Google\u2019s is in C++. And I have so\u00a0\nmany friends who work on the backends of companies\u00a0\u00a0 like Microsoft, Uber and Facebook and they don\u2019t\u00a0\nuse Python in their services at all. Since my goal\u00a0\u00a0 from day 1 was to become a good Software Engineer\u00a0\nalong with getting a job, I would actually pick\u00a0\u00a0 the third option which is Java. Along with\u00a0the performance benefits I just mentioned,\u00a0\u00a0 Java has some other advantages for beginners.\u00a0\nJava is a mature language and there\u2019re a ton of\u00a0\u00a0 resources to learn Java. Because it\u2019s a compiled\u00a0\nlanguage, errors in Java can be caught at the compile time\u00a0\u00a0 and are very descriptive. Since Java has been\u00a0\naround for so long, you can find solutions to\u00a0\u00a0 most errors on Stack Overflow which makes it very\u00a0\neasy to debug. And did I mention the amazing\u00a0\u00a0 documentation Oracle provides for Java. We\u2019ll see\u00a0\nhow to use this documentation in a moment when I cover\u00a0\u00a0 how I would learn Java. But, I have\u00a0\nstill not told you the best part about learning\u00a0\u00a0 Java. And that is: Once you\u2019ve learnt Java, you\u00a0\ncan pick up any other language very easily. For me,\u00a0\u00a0 I started with learning Java. When I felt I needed\u00a0\nPython to speed up my interview performance,\u00a0\u00a0 I picked it up in a couple of weeks. When\u00a0\nI wanted to learn web development using\u00a0\u00a0 Javascript based React, that didn\u2019t take me a\u00a0\nlong time either. And as I switched jobs,\u00a0\u00a0 I had to program in C++, Golang and some\u00a0\nother languages and I never had any problems. Now that we have that out of the way, let\u2019s talk about Step 1, which is: Learn Java. If you have watched any\u00a0\u00a0 of my previous videos before, you know that I\u00a0\nam a strong believer in learning by doing. So,\u00a0\u00a0 instead of falling asleep while\u00a0\nwatching a long Java tutorial,\u00a0\u00a0 I would actually get to work and start coding.\u00a0\nLet me show you some resources that I would use.\u00a0\u00a0 The best free resource to learn Java interactively\u00a0\nis this aptly named course called \u201cLearn Java\u201d on\u00a0\u00a0 Codeacademy. On top of covering basic concepts\u00a0\nlike variables, if else statements and loops,\u00a0\u00a0 this course also teaches slightly advanced\u00a0\nconcepts like Object Oriented Programming,\u00a0\u00a0 Encapsulation and Inheritance. I would pay special\u00a0\nattention to these advanced concepts because these\u00a0\u00a0 are the fundamentals of Software Development. Each\u00a0\nchapter comes with a free \u201cLesson\u201d portion and\u00a0\u00a0 paid \u201cQuiz\u201d and \u201cProject\u201d. I would focus on the\u00a0free\nlesson part for now. Each lesson introduces you to\u00a0\u00a0 a new concept, and guides you through an exercise\u00a0\nat the end. It also provides you a way to write\u00a0\u00a0 and run all the code within the browser. If you\u2019re\u00a0\nstuck, you can also get a hint. Here are 2 things\u00a0\u00a0 I would not do while using Codecademy. Number one,\u00a0\nI would not copy paste the code. When you write\u00a0\u00a0 the code yourself, you get used to the syntax.\u00a0\nNumber two, I would not use the hint before trying\u00a0\u00a0 to solve the problem myself. Another advantage of\u00a0\nlearning programming this way is that if I make\u00a0\u00a0 a mistake, I\u2019ll have to debug the error myself. I can\u00a0\nalways google the error and look for the solution\u00a0\u00a0 on websites like Stack Overflow. \nI can also try to debug the error using the Java\u00a0\u00a0 documentation. For example, in this error, I can\u00a0\nsee that the printline function doesn\u2019t exist. So,\u00a0\u00a0 I can go to the documentation and figure out what\u00a0\nfunctions are actually available to me. If I could\u00a0\u00a0 spend some money, I would do this course called \u201cLearn\u00a0\nJava from scratch\u201d on Educative. This course is\u00a0\u00a0 very comprehensive and also gives you challenges\u00a0\nand quizzes at the end of every chapter. Now that I have learnt Java, I\u2019ll move\u00a0\nonto the next step, which is Step number 2:\u00a0\u00a0 Build Guided Projects. In this step, I will follow\u00a0\nalong with instructors as they build some cool\u00a0\u00a0 projects in Java. There are many options that I\u00a0\ncan choose from but here are a few examples. For\u00a0\u00a0 my first project, I would follow this tutorial\u00a0\nfrom freecodecamp where the instructor builds\u00a0\u00a0 Sudoku from scratch. There are many things that I\u00a0\nwon\u2019t understand in this tutorial at first but I\u00a0\u00a0 would google everything and use Java documentation\u00a0\nto understand as much as I can. Once I am done\u00a0\u00a0 with the first project, I would move onto a\u00a0\nslightly advanced project. For my second project,\u00a0\u00a0 I would build a snake game that I used to play\u00a0\non my dad\u2019s Nokia 3315 back in the day. For that,\u00a0\u00a0 I would follow this fun tutorial from \u201cbro\u00a0\ncode\u201d. Even though bro explains everything very\u00a0\u00a0 well but if I still don\u2019t understand something,\u00a0\nI know that Java documentation is my friend. After following these tutorials, let\u2019s move onto\u00a0\nstep 3, which is, Build your own projects. To do\u00a0 that, I would start with a small idea and keep\u00a0\nexpanding on it to build a bigger and better\u00a0\u00a0 project. Let me give you an example to show\u00a0\nyou what I mean by that. In the first 2 steps,\u00a0\u00a0 I would have already learnt the basics of Java.\u00a0\nBut, the elusive concepts like Polymorphism and\u00a0\u00a0 Inheritance are very easy to forget. So, I\u00a0\nwould build a program that helps me remember\u00a0\u00a0 the concepts that I have already learnt. This\u00a0\nprogram gives me a random question to answer from\u00a0\u00a0 a pre-stored list of questions. To make it more\u00a0\ninteresting, I can make these questions multiple\u00a0\u00a0 choice and give the program ability to tell if\u00a0\nI chose the right option. I can also make this\u00a0\u00a0 program send a question every day to my inbox to\u00a0\nkeep me on track with my learning. If I am looking\u00a0\u00a0 for some more adventure, I can move this program\u00a0\nto a server rather than using my own computer.\u00a0\u00a0 I will call this program from my computer and\u00a0\nit will send back the question and the answer\u00a0\u00a0 options to me. By the way, this program would now be called\u00a0\nan API. Instead of storing these questions in\u00a0\u00a0 an array or something similar, I would store them\u00a0\nin a database on the server. If I want to take it\u00a0\u00a0 to the next level, I can use the Java that I have\u00a0\nalready learnt to make an Android app that calls\u00a0\u00a0 my API, shows the question and lets me select\u00a0my answer on the app. There's no end to it, I hope you got the point. After building my own projects,\u00a0\nI would move onto the step 4,\u00a0\u00a0 which is, Learning Data Structures and Algorithms.\u00a0\nWhen I was learning Java and building projects,\u00a0\u00a0 I would have come across many data structures\u00a0\nlike Array, ArrayLists and Maps etc. As a\u00a0\u00a0 Software Engineer, it\u2019s very important to know\u00a0\nwhen exactly to use these data structures. You\u00a0\u00a0 also need to know some algorithms that can help\u00a0\nyou do certain tasks efficiently. For example,\u00a0\u00a0 if you wanted to find the shortest path\u00a0\nbetween point a and point b on the map,\u00a0\u00a0 like Google maps does, how would you do it? To\u00a0\nlearn Data Structures and Algorithms, I would\u00a0\u00a0 go to Coursera and look up this course called\u00a0\nAlgorithms by Princeton University. This course\u00a0\u00a0 is taught in Java and comes in 2 parts. First part\u00a0\ncovers data structures like stacks, queues and\u00a0\u00a0 algorithms like MergeSort and Union Find. Second\u00a0\npart covers advanced concepts like graphs, tries,\u00a0\u00a0 shortest path etc. I would implement some of\u00a0\nthese data structures and algorithms by myself\u00a0\u00a0 to further solidify my knowledge and improve\u00a0\nmy Java skills. This course also forms the basis of\u00a0\u00a0 most tech interviews that I will have to go through to get a job.\u00a0\nSo, I would pay special attention to this course.\u00a0\u00a0 I would also use resources like Geeksforgeeks\u00a0\nand Leetcode to improve my interviewing skills. If you think that this entire path\u00a0\nis too long and you are looking for\u00a0\u00a0 a shortcut to learn programming and get\u00a0\na job, you can watch this video at the\u00a0\u00a0 top.

As you might have already guessed,\u00a0\nthis path is long and hard for beginners. That\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 why I would not pick Javascript if I was just\u00a0\nstarting out. Next popular option is learning\u00a0\u00a0 Python which most people recommend. Python has\u00a0\nmany applications in backend, automation and\u00a0\u00a0 data science. Why most people recommend Python\u00a0\nis because it\u2019s one of the easiest language to learn.\u00a0\u00a0 Syntax of python is very simple and easy to pick.\u00a0\nPython will also give you an advantage in coding\u00a0\u00a0 interviews because it requires less lines of\u00a0\ncode for the same amount of code. Due to all these\u00a0\u00a0 advantages, I had recommended Python in my video\u00a0\non Fastest way to learn coding and get a job. But,\u00a0\u00a0 this video is not about taking shortcuts.\nWhat we need to understand is that all this\u00a0\u00a0 ease of learning comes at the cost of\u00a0\nperformance. I don\u2019t want to get into\u00a0\u00a0 too many details here but Python is slower than\u00a0\nother programming languages like Java or C++.\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s because it\u2019s dynamically typed and it\u2019s an\u00a0\ninterpreted language. If you don't know what that\u00a0\u00a0 is, that\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it. Just know\u00a0\nthat Python is slower. Another issue with Python\u00a0\u00a0 is that it has limited support for concurrency.\u00a0\nFor these reasons, Python is rarely used to\u00a0\u00a0 build complex backend systems. If I look at my own\u00a0\nexperience, most of Amazon's backend is written in\u00a0\u00a0 Java and most of Google\u2019s is in C++. And I have so\u00a0\nmany friends who work on the backends of companies\u00a0\u00a0 like Microsoft, Uber and Facebook and they don\u2019t\u00a0\nuse Python in their services at all. Since my goal\u00a0\u00a0 from day 1 was to become a good Software Engineer\u00a0\nalong with getting a job, I would actually pick\u00a0\u00a0 the third option which is Java. Along with\u00a0the performance benefits I just mentioned,\u00a0\u00a0 Java has some other advantages for beginners.\u00a0\nJava is a mature language and there\u2019re a ton of\u00a0\u00a0 resources to learn Java. Because it\u2019s a compiled\u00a0\nlanguage, errors in Java can be caught at the compile time\u00a0\u00a0 and are very descriptive. Since Java has been\u00a0\naround for so long, you can find solutions to\u00a0\u00a0 most errors on Stack Overflow which makes it very\u00a0\neasy to debug. And did I mention the amazing\u00a0\u00a0 documentation Oracle provides for Java. We\u2019ll see\u00a0\nhow to use this documentation in a moment when I cover\u00a0\u00a0 how I would learn Java. But, I have\u00a0\nstill not told you the best part about learning\u00a0\u00a0 Java. And that is: Once you\u2019ve learnt Java, you\u00a0\ncan pick up any other language very easily. For me,\u00a0\u00a0 I started with learning Java. When I felt I needed\u00a0\nPython to speed up my interview performance,\u00a0\u00a0 I picked it up in a couple of weeks. When\u00a0\nI wanted to learn web development using\u00a0\u00a0 Javascript based React, that didn\u2019t take me a\u00a0\nlong time either. And as I switched jobs,\u00a0\u00a0 I had to program in C++, Golang and some\u00a0\nother languages and I never had any problems. Now that we have that out of the way, let\u2019s talk about Step 1, which is: Learn Java. If you have watched any\u00a0\u00a0 of my previous videos before, you know that I\u00a0\nam a strong believer in learning by doing. So,\u00a0\u00a0 instead of falling asleep while\u00a0\nwatching a long Java tutorial,\u00a0\u00a0 I would actually get to work and start coding.\u00a0\nLet me show you some resources that I would use.\u00a0\u00a0 The best free resource to learn Java interactively\u00a0\nis this aptly named course called \u201cLearn Java\u201d on\u00a0\u00a0 Codeacademy. On top of covering basic concepts\u00a0\nlike variables, if else statements and loops,\u00a0\u00a0 this course also teaches slightly advanced\u00a0\nconcepts like Object Oriented Programming,\u00a0\u00a0 Encapsulation and Inheritance. I would pay special\u00a0\nattention to these advanced concepts because these\u00a0\u00a0 are the fundamentals of Software Development. Each\u00a0\nchapter comes with a free \u201cLesson\u201d portion and\u00a0\u00a0 paid \u201cQuiz\u201d and \u201cProject\u201d. I would focus on the\u00a0free\nlesson part for now. Each lesson introduces you to\u00a0\u00a0 a new concept, and guides you through an exercise\u00a0\nat the end. It also provides you a way to write\u00a0\u00a0 and run all the code within the browser. If you\u2019re\u00a0\nstuck, you can also get a hint. Here are 2 things\u00a0\u00a0 I would not do while using Codecademy. Number one,\u00a0\nI would not copy paste the code. When you write\u00a0\u00a0 the code yourself, you get used to the syntax.\u00a0\nNumber two, I would not use the hint before trying\u00a0\u00a0 to solve the problem myself. Another advantage of\u00a0\nlearning programming this way is that if I make\u00a0\u00a0 a mistake, I\u2019ll have to debug the error myself. I can\u00a0\nalways google the error and look for the solution\u00a0\u00a0 on websites like Stack Overflow. \nI can also try to debug the error using the Java\u00a0\u00a0 documentation. For example, in this error, I can\u00a0\nsee that the printline function doesn\u2019t exist. So,\u00a0\u00a0 I can go to the documentation and figure out what\u00a0\nfunctions are actually available to me. If I could\u00a0\u00a0 spend some money, I would do this course called \u201cLearn\u00a0\nJava from scratch\u201d on Educative. This course is\u00a0\u00a0 very comprehensive and also gives you challenges\u00a0\nand quizzes at the end of every chapter. Now that I have learnt Java, I\u2019ll move\u00a0\nonto the next step, which is Step number 2:\u00a0\u00a0 Build Guided Projects. In this step, I will follow\u00a0\nalong with instructors as they build some cool\u00a0\u00a0 projects in Java. There are many options that I\u00a0\ncan choose from but here are a few examples. For\u00a0\u00a0 my first project, I would follow this tutorial\u00a0\nfrom freecodecamp where the instructor builds\u00a0\u00a0 Sudoku from scratch. There are many things that I\u00a0\nwon\u2019t understand in this tutorial at first but I\u00a0\u00a0 would google everything and use Java documentation\u00a0\nto understand as much as I can. Once I am done\u00a0\u00a0 with the first project, I would move onto a\u00a0\nslightly advanced project. For my second project,\u00a0\u00a0 I would build a snake game that I used to play\u00a0\non my dad\u2019s Nokia 3315 back in the day. For that,\u00a0\u00a0 I would follow this fun tutorial from \u201cbro\u00a0\ncode\u201d. Even though bro explains everything very\u00a0\u00a0 well but if I still don\u2019t understand something,\u00a0\nI know that Java documentation is my friend. After following these tutorials, let\u2019s move onto\u00a0\nstep 3, which is, Build your own projects. To do\u00a0 that, I would start with a small idea and keep\u00a0\nexpanding on it to build a bigger and better\u00a0\u00a0 project. Let me give you an example to show\u00a0\nyou what I mean by that. In the first 2 steps,\u00a0\u00a0 I would have already learnt the basics of Java.\u00a0\nBut, the elusive concepts like Polymorphism and\u00a0\u00a0 Inheritance are very easy to forget. So, I\u00a0\nwould build a program that helps me remember\u00a0\u00a0 the concepts that I have already learnt. This\u00a0\nprogram gives me a random question to answer from\u00a0\u00a0 a pre-stored list of questions. To make it more\u00a0\ninteresting, I can make these questions multiple\u00a0\u00a0 choice and give the program ability to tell if\u00a0\nI chose the right option. I can also make this\u00a0\u00a0 program send a question every day to my inbox to\u00a0\nkeep me on track with my learning. If I am looking\u00a0\u00a0 for some more adventure, I can move this program\u00a0\nto a server rather than using my own computer.\u00a0\u00a0 I will call this program from my computer and\u00a0\nit will send back the question and the answer\u00a0\u00a0 options to me. By the way, this program would now be called\u00a0\nan API. Instead of storing these questions in\u00a0\u00a0 an array or something similar, I would store them\u00a0\nin a database on the server. If I want to take it\u00a0\u00a0 to the next level, I can use the Java that I have\u00a0\nalready learnt to make an Android app that calls\u00a0\u00a0 my API, shows the question and lets me select\u00a0my answer on the app. There's no end to it, I hope you got the point. After building my own projects,\u00a0\nI would move onto the step 4,\u00a0\u00a0 which is, Learning Data Structures and Algorithms.\u00a0\nWhen I was learning Java and building projects,\u00a0\u00a0 I would have come across many data structures\u00a0\nlike Array, ArrayLists and Maps etc. As a\u00a0\u00a0 Software Engineer, it\u2019s very important to know\u00a0\nwhen exactly to use these data structures. You\u00a0\u00a0 also need to know some algorithms that can help\u00a0\nyou do certain tasks efficiently. For example,\u00a0\u00a0 if you wanted to find the shortest path\u00a0\nbetween point a and point b on the map,\u00a0\u00a0 like Google maps does, how would you do it? To\u00a0\nlearn Data Structures and Algorithms, I would\u00a0\u00a0 go to Coursera and look up this course called\u00a0\nAlgorithms by Princeton University. This course\u00a0\u00a0 is taught in Java and comes in 2 parts. First part\u00a0\ncovers data structures like stacks, queues and\u00a0\u00a0 algorithms like MergeSort and Union Find. Second\u00a0\npart covers advanced concepts like graphs, tries,\u00a0\u00a0 shortest path etc. I would implement some of\u00a0\nthese data structures and algorithms by myself\u00a0\u00a0 to further solidify my knowledge and improve\u00a0\nmy Java skills. This course also forms the basis of\u00a0\u00a0 most tech interviews that I will have to go through to get a job.\u00a0\nSo, I would pay special attention to this course.\u00a0\u00a0 I would also use resources like Geeksforgeeks\u00a0\nand Leetcode to improve my interviewing skills. If you think that this entire path\u00a0\nis too long and you are looking for\u00a0\u00a0 a shortcut to learn programming and get\u00a0\na job, you can watch this video at the\u00a0\u00a0 top. I will see you in the next one.", "timestamp": "2024-06-20 00:26:14"}, {"video_id": "PWirijQkH4M&t", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWirijQkH4M&t=5s", "summary": "**Obstacle Course Challenge**\n\n**Introduction**\n\n* Challenge creator builds the deadliest obstacle course in the world.\n* Mack, a previous contestant, attempts to complete six courses to win $800,000.\n\n**Level 1: Swinging Hammers**\n\n* Mack leaps over swinging hammers to reach a platform.\n\n**Level 2: Balance Beam or Monkey Bars**\n\n* Mack chooses to navigate monkey bars over a balance beam.\n* He dangles precariously before locking in on the bars.\n* He completes the course, narrowly avoiding a fall.\n\n**Level 3: Memory and Tiles**\n\n* Mack must memorize a pattern on the floor and step on green tiles only while holding down a button.\n* Failure results in an explosion destroying the money.\n* After several attempts, Mack successfully navigates the course.\n\n**Level 4: Log Roll and Balls**\n\n* Mack uses a chocolate bar", "transcript": " I have built the most\ndeadly obstacle course in the world, and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it\nwithout falling 200 feet to the ground. Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man.", "timestamp": "2024-06-20 00:46:04"}, {"video_id": "PWirijQkH4M&t", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWirijQkH4M&t=5s", "summary": "**Level 1: The Deadly Heights**\n\n* Mack jumps across swinging hammers on a platform 200 feet in the air.\n\n**Level 2: The Maze of Mental Torture**\n\n* Mack must choose between a balance beam or monkey bars and cross a floor with green tiles while memorizing a 44-tile pattern.

Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man.", "timestamp": "2024-06-20 00:46:27"}, {"video_id": "PWirijQkH4M&t", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWirijQkH4M&t=5s", "summary": "**Deadly Obstacle Course Challenge**\n\n**Overview:**\n\nA YouTube personality challenges his friend Mack to complete a series of six deadly obstacle courses for a prize of $800,000.\n\n**Obstacle Course 1:**\n\n* **Challenge:** Jump across swinging hammers and land on a platform 200 feet in the air.\n* **Outcome:** Mack successfully completes the first jump.\n\n**Obstacle Course 2:**\n\n* **Challenge:** Navigate a monkey bar course or a balance beam over a 100-foot drop.\n* **Outcome:** Mack chooses monkey bars and falls 100 feet into a net.

Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella.

[contestants clapping and cheering] - Woo! Yes! - Team Mr. Beast is going first. Who is going to do the challenge? - I'll do it. I don't know. [contestants clapping and cheering] - The first round is\ncalled Honeycomb Maze. - You must find the exit to the maze without getting stopped by the bees. - And the team with the fastest total time wins. Once you walk in, I'm\ngonna start the timer. - Oh, God.\n- Are you ready? - Goofy Goobers, you good? - We're ready.\n- Yeah! [contestant laughing] - Look at this bee. - 3. 2. 1. Let's go!\n[horn blowing] - Good luck, Jimmy. - Go! He's going! Go! Go right, go right! Keep going! - Why's the bee not moving? - Go right!\n- He's actually elite. [indistinct] This man is moving quick. - What are the bees doing? - Boom! [indistinct yelling] [contestants clapping and cheering] - You know what? This is too easy. [confetti popping] Let's go. - 8.5 seconds.\n- Yes! - I mean, he's done it. He's done it. He's done it. We've got an eight minute\nSidemen Sunday boys. - Oh, you silly, silly boys. You thought you could get rid of me? Well, guess what? Never! It's Ethan, and I'm here to tell you to hit that subscribe button. We are not at 17 million subscribers yet. What are you doing? Click the red button! [fire exploding] - So is Sidemen team going now? - Yeah. - All right. Who's going? [indistinct chattering]\n- Yeah, I'll go. I'll go. - You gotta beat that. 8 seconds. - Oh my gosh. - How am I even gonna beat that? - Were there even bees in there? - Bro, yes and you just\ndodged all of them. [Jimmy laughing] - If JJ finishes it, he'll be lucky. - I think JJ's best option is just brute. - He's going to fight a bee. - Just literally just run. - JJ, are you ready? - Yeah. - You've got a very tough time to beat. 3, 2, 1, go. [horn blowing]\n- Go on, JJ! - He's off. He's off. He's off. - He already ran into one. - Oh. [contestants laughing and cheering] - [Simon Run, JJ, run! - Sounds like he's\nsmashing every damn door. [contestants laughing] - Bro, the door sound effect. [contestants laughing] [contestants screaming and laughing] - He just pushed the bee. - He just shoved the bee. - f*ckin- Fam! - Someone tell him the\nbee's not Logan Paul. - It seems like he's hit every door but the right one.\n- Get off me! No. Ah! Get off me! - He may actually die in this maze. Is there food and water in\nthere? Because he might run out. - Oh my God. [bee buzzing] - It's right there. It's right there. - Oh God! No! - No it wasn't. Bro.\n[indistinct] - He's tried every door at this point. - We're coming up on the clock. - He thinks he's tried every door. - Oh my God. - Wait, wait, wait, he\njust kicked the door open. - That wasn't the right door,\nbut I still stopped the timer. - Go back in!\n- That's not the exit. - Go back in.\n- Go back in. - I mean, I technically stopped the timer. They don't have to know that. And, okay. He's broken another door.\n- No! - No, go through that one. It's this one. - Stop breaking the doors! - Now he knows where it is. - You're almost there.\nYou've almost got it. There we go. [contestants clapping] - Nice. - We'll give him a participation trophy. - A minute sixteen. - Oh wow. Okay. - No confetti for you. I'm sorry. - Oh... - We should subtract 10 seconds\nfor kicking down a door. That was funny. - Yeah, that's alright.\nLet's give him 56 seconds. - Ah, nice.\n[contestants clapping] - Team Sidemen, Who do you want to compete next? - We need someone smart. - We need our equivalent. Nimble. - Oh, Nimble. Nimble. - Yeah, Vik. - All right, let's go.\n- Go on, Vik. [clapping]\n- Go on, Vik! - I'm gonna go sneaky, stealth mode. - Um, I wouldn't, I would go very fast. 3, 2, 1. Go in. [horn blowing] - Here we go, go on! Go on, Vik. You're going the wrong way. - Okay. How's Vikkstar doing? He's the smartest of the Sidemen. I'm worried for him. He's already passed Jimmy's time. Pressure is gonna be mounting. It's not looking good for the Sidemen. - Maybe this is smart. - Where's the finish line? - No, the bees don't know where he is. - There's a bee there. On the right! - Oh, no, no, no, no, no\nthat bee has seen him. [door hitting wall]\n[Vik screaming] [contestants yelling] - Run Vik. - Get off me. - He might be starting to panic. [Josh chuckling]\n- Get off me! - He might be getting claustrophobic. Go back in- [Vik yelling] [laughing] He came out the entrance. - Well that bee is on him. - He's moving so fast though. - He's getting gang banged by two bees. [Vik yelling] - Yes!\n[contestants cheering] - So Vik, so come on here.\n- Well done, Vik. - It wasn't awful. It wasn't awful. - It just wasn't great.\n- It wasn't awful. - Vikkstar did it in exactly one minute. [contestants slightly clapping] - One minute forty-eight\nseconds versus eight seconds. Chris, you can't possibly screw this up. - Don't say that. - Literally, even if\nyou tried, you couldn't. - I believe in you. Come\non, look at the ground. - Now that I've seen other people do it, how did it take you eight seconds? - All right, Chris, are you ready? - I'm ready, Freddy. - You've only got to beat one\nminute forty eight seconds. - I think I can do it maybe. - 3, 2, 1. Go in.\n[horn blowing] [clapping]\n- Here we go. - Faster! - Oh, there he is. I\nthink he's in the middle. [Chris laughing] - Oh, he's being raped. [Chris screaming] - Oh he's so big. Oh the bees are double teaming him. - Get outta there. - Where do I go? [laughing] Buzz off! - Oh my god, he's getting\nclose. He's getting close. - Keep going, Chris, keep going. - He's gonna find it. - Oh ho ho, no.\n- Yes, yes! [contestants laughing] - Hold him. [struggled grunting] Hold him! - Kick the bee! - The bee is making this really hard. [contestants cheering] [Chris yelling] I'm getting bee made.

[contestants yelling] - Go, go, go, go, go. Win this. Win this.\nThis is it. This is it. - No! - That's a foul. - He won. - Chris just won. - He pushed him through to beat him. [contestants laughing] - It was you, me, me, you. - He pushed him through, but he won. [contestant laughing] - Is Chris alright? [contestants laughing and clapping] - I was just in war. - I put my arm through a wall. - I just pushed you through that one. - I know it's fine. As I dove through, I hit my knee and I was just like, I'm still\nwinning it doesn't matter. [contestants laughing] - You guys are trying\nto lose at this point. [contestants laughing] - Like, what the hell? - Nolan, don't mess up or\nyou're off the channel. - 3.\n- Hold them back. - 2, 1, go. [horn blowing] - Go [indistinct]!

I didn't even get to a door\nbefore he got through it. - You are being embarrassed\non your own channel. - Our strategy was, I was\nlike, yo, you spearhead, I'll just let you know\nif you messed up or not. - I didn't mess up though.\n- He didn't mess up. He didn't mess up.\n- How?! - You just gonna leave me hanging. - Oh, that was embarrassing. - Hey, buddy.\n[contestant laughing] - They spent half a million\ndollars on this video just for us to come in here and [laughs]. - Sweep the floor. - Like how did you, when you\nlooked at this, for example? - To me it just looks slightly different. - Wait, so Nolan came in first? - Yes. - Who came in second? - That's what I was asking. I was so focused on Nolan. - I'm gonna say it. Not even a competition. - Come on.\n- I knew it was coming. [contestants clapping] - Come on. - There's nothing we can\ndo there.

[contestants laughing] - We need someone, we need someone lightweight\non the next one. - The people that assembled\nthis forgot the screws. All right, it's only been two seconds since the last race.

[contestants clapping and cheering] - Woo! Yes! - Team Mr. Beast is going first. Who is going to do the challenge? - I'll do it. I don't know. [contestants clapping and cheering] - The first round is\ncalled Honeycomb Maze. - You must find the exit to the maze without getting stopped by the bees. - And the team with the fastest total time wins. Once you walk in, I'm\ngonna start the timer. - Oh, God.\n- Are you ready? - Goofy Goobers, you good? - We're ready.\n- Yeah! [contestant laughing] - Look at this bee. - 3. 2. 1. Let's go!\n[horn blowing] - Good luck, Jimmy. - Go! He's going! Go! Go right, go right! Keep going! - Why's the bee not moving? - Go right!\n- He's actually elite. [indistinct] This man is moving quick. - What are the bees doing? - Boom! [indistinct yelling] [contestants clapping and cheering] - You know what? This is too easy. [confetti popping] Let's go. - 8.5 seconds.\n- Yes! - I mean, he's done it. He's done it. He's done it. We've got an eight minute\nSidemen Sunday boys. - Oh, you silly, silly boys. You thought you could get rid of me? Well, guess what? Never! It's Ethan, and I'm here to tell you to hit that subscribe button. We are not at 17 million subscribers yet. What are you doing? Click the red button! [fire exploding] - So is Sidemen team going now? - Yeah. - All right. Who's going? [indistinct chattering]\n- Yeah, I'll go. I'll go. - You gotta beat that. 8 seconds. - Oh my gosh. - How am I even gonna beat that? - Were there even bees in there? - Bro, yes and you just\ndodged all of them. [Jimmy laughing] - If JJ finishes it, he'll be lucky. - I think JJ's best option is just brute. - He's going to fight a bee. - Just literally just run. - JJ, are you ready? - Yeah. - You've got a very tough time to beat. 3, 2, 1, go. [horn blowing]\n- Go on, JJ! - He's off. He's off. He's off. - He already ran into one. - Oh. [contestants laughing and cheering] - [Simon Run, JJ, run! - Sounds like he's\nsmashing every damn door.

No. Ah! Get off me! - He may actually die in this maze. Is there food and water in\nthere? Because he might run out. - Oh my God. [bee buzzing] - It's right there. It's right there. - Oh God! No! - No it wasn't. Bro.\n[indistinct] - He's tried every door at this point. - We're coming up on the clock. - He thinks he's tried every door. - Oh my God. - Wait, wait, wait, he\njust kicked the door open. - That wasn't the right door,\nbut I still stopped the timer. - Go back in!\n- That's not the exit. - Go back in.\n- Go back in. - I mean, I technically stopped the timer. They don't have to know that. And, okay. He's broken another door.\n- No! - No, go through that one. It's this one. - Stop breaking the doors! - Now he knows where it is. - You're almost there.\nYou've almost got it. There we go. [contestants clapping] - Nice. - We'll give him a participation trophy. - A minute sixteen. - Oh wow. Okay. - No confetti for you. I'm sorry. - Oh... - We should subtract 10 seconds\nfor kicking down a door. That was funny. - Yeah, that's alright.\nLet's give him 56 seconds. - Ah, nice.\n[contestants clapping] - Team Sidemen, Who do you want to compete next? - We need someone smart. - We need our equivalent.

Pressure is gonna be mounting. It's not looking good for the Sidemen. - Maybe this is smart. - Where's the finish line? - No, the bees don't know where he is. - There's a bee there. On the right! - Oh, no, no, no, no, no\nthat bee has seen him. [door hitting wall]\n[Vik screaming] [contestants yelling] - Run Vik. - Get off me. - He might be starting to panic.

Chris, you can't possibly screw this up. - Don't say that. - Literally, even if\nyou tried, you couldn't. - I believe in you. Come\non, look at the ground. - Now that I've seen other people do it, how did it take you eight seconds? - All right, Chris, are you ready? - I'm ready, Freddy. - You've only got to beat one\nminute forty eight seconds. - I think I can do it maybe. - 3, 2, 1. Go in.\n[horn blowing] [clapping]\n- Here we go. - Faster! - Oh, there he is. I\nthink he's in the middle. [Chris laughing] - Oh, he's being raped. [Chris screaming] - Oh he's so big.

[contestants laughing] - It was you, me, me, you. - He pushed him through, but he won. [contestant laughing] - Is Chris alright? [contestants laughing and clapping] - I was just in war. - I put my arm through a wall. - I just pushed you through that one. - I know it's fine. As I dove through, I hit my knee and I was just like, I'm still\nwinning it doesn't matter. [contestants laughing] - You guys are trying\nto lose at this point.

[indistinct yelling] - Oh!\n[clapping and yelling] - America! [contestants clapping] - America! - I think he was out of bounds. He was out of bounds. - No shot. No shot. - It's a touchdown. [contestants cheering] - Oh, let's go. - Lazerbeam is an idiot 'cause he definitely\nstepped out like four times. - Yo, that turtle's stuck. Everybody make fun of that turtle. [JJ grunting] - Hey, pile on. - Do you wanna say goodbye to it? - Piss off. [contestants laughing] - What is this?\n- Whatever that is. - What is that? - I don't know what that\nis, but I'm not there. [contestants chanting] - If they can get JJ\nin the middle of that. - Yeah [laughing]\n- He's done for. - I think he's just\ngonna breeze through 'em. They ain't gonna stop him realistically. - How long do you guys think it's gonna take KSI to do this? I think maybe five seconds. - JJ remember you can't, we actually have to win this one, man. - Guys, can you start from the 20? - Hey, they want us to\nstart from the 20 yard line. - Hey, how 'bout you suck my nut sack? - Come on, JJ. - Let's go, JJ. [horn blowing] - Oh, god.\n- He's off. - Oh. Oooh! - He's overdoing it. He's overdoing it. He's overdoing it. - Get him!\n- He's overdoing it! - No! [contestants laughing] [contestants cheering] - Yes! What! [grunting and yelling] [contestants laughing] [grunting] - Alright. - What do I do? - Don't f*cking lose. [contestants laughing] - Okay guys, do me a favour. Crunch this mutha f*cka. - Dude, Nolan's gonna get destroyed. - Look at him. He just looks terrified. - Josh is really strategizing, by the way. - Well, they got a formation. - We have a very obvious weak side. I'm just saying when you have Josh, JJ, and\nHarry in a line like that, and then you have Tobi, Vik,\nand you can just run at them. - What's wrong with Tobi and Vik? - They're just very petite. - What do you mean by that? - Small, pequeno. - Hey, what's wrong with petite? - Yeah! - Don't let him through, boys. Do not let him through. [contestant yelling] - Come on, lads! [chanting]\nCome on, lads! - Do this buddy. [clapping]\n- Wow, they're intimidating. [horn blowing] - All right. [indistinct yelling] - What is that run? Oh, no. - Hold him back-\n- Oh! - Hold him, hold him.\n[clapping and yelling] [indistinct yelling] - Oh, the Josh. - Josh has got him. [contestants laughing] - You're not done. Get back in there, son. - He's not done. - He's still going. - Keep going. - Go Josh.\n- Go! [contestants laughing] - Josh really tried. - Nolan just got man handled. - I don't think I got 10 feet. [contestants laughing] - Two. - Got a win. - I want Harry to get one on his ass. Like I want him to push someone over. - He doesn't even have pads on. - Harry, are you ready? - Come on, Beast. - Come on, Harry.\n- Let's go, Harry. - Let's go, Harry. - Let's go, Harry, let's go. [horn blowing]\n- Go on now! - Oh no.\n- He's fumbled. - Oh no. - Go, go, go. - Oh no he's down.\n- Oh no. - Coach. - Thanks for giving me the opportunity. - Hey, I want to tell\nyou, boy, you can do it. You're gonna go all the way to state. - I ain't gonna say\nmuch, but I am gonna say, you either run or you're dead. [Tobi yelling]\n[horn blowing] - Here we go, lads. - Oh no.\n- Nice. Nice. - Oh.\n- Well, in the flip flop- - You just gotta hold it. You just gotta hold it- - He's wearing flip flops. [contestants laughing]\n- Keep him there, man. - They got speed, bro. - Nice. - Oh. - Oh. Take him down boys.\n[indistinct yelling] - You either run or you're dead. - Run, Chan, run. [contestants cheering] - Get back up, get back up. [contestants cheering] - Oh, he's wearing flip flops. Why don't we take that into consideration? - Let's go, boys. [contestants cheering and laughing] - Yeah! - Hey, he was in flip flops. In hindsight, not the best strategy. - Come on, Tobi. - Let's go, Tobi.\n- Let's go. - Tobi!\n- Let's go. [contestants clapping and cheering] - His movement. Watch. - His movement's crazy. - Yo, he's about to be here\nwithout even realising it- - He's gonna slide cancel. - How many seconds you give him? - I think he might do it in\nlike six seconds, you know. - Really? - Come on, Tobi. - Come on, Jizzle. - Let's go! [clapping]\n- Tobi. - Give 'em the jizz. - Tobi. Tobi. Tobi- [horn blowing]\nTobi. Tobi. Tobi. [yelling] - Come on, Beast. - Oh, there's a gap here. - Oh! - Watch out for the wall. - Oh!\n- Tobi! [contestants clapping and yelling] - Yeah! What, what! [contestants grunting] - And the winner of that challenge, finally on the scoreboard... - Yes.\n- Yes! - After so many challenges. [contestants laughing] - We felt, we felt bad. - Yeah. - Team Sidemen. - Yeah! - We had to give 'em one.\n- Woo! - I'm keeping the jersey. - Hey. Football is their thing. If we beat them it\nwould've been embarrassing. - I was gonna say, the American sport is when\nyou finally showed up. [contestants laughing] What are you doing? - Let's do baseball or basketball. - Oh no, no, no.\n- Please no. Please no. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - With the score already being 3-1 to Mr. Beast's team, we\nhave to raise the stakes. For this last round, whichever team wins, wins the whole video. - The first person to\nstop in the right place, exactly above the arrow,\nwins for their team. - If you don't go far enough, or you go too far, you get dunked in the pool. [upbeat music] - I'm gonna show you boys\nhow this challenge is done. - Go on, son. - He's got the surfer in him. - Oh, whoa.\n- Oh no. [contestants yelling]\n- Oh! - No! [contestants laughing and clapping] - Oh, you almost did it though. - That was actually really close. - That was really close...\n- That was- - I'd recommend going slower. - On a scale of 1 to 10,\nhow freezing are you? - Oh, my f*ckin' balls are in my body. [contestants laughing] - You're... - Hug me, Jimmy. [contestants laughing] - So this is what happens if you fail. [contestants laughing]\n- Gotcha. Who, which team goes first? - Team Sidemen. - I agree. [laughing and clapping]\nI agree. I agree. - For God's sake, man. - Hey, son! - Come on JJ.\n- Come on JJ. - Come on. - We believe in you. - I'm scared. - It's not that bad, buddy. [contestants chanting] - Don't celebrate first. - Ooooooh... - Oh, that's way too much gas- Oh!\n- Wait. - Ah...sh*t. [contestants indistinctly cheering] [contestant screaming] [contestants laughing and clapping] - Yo, he decked the GoPro. [JJ shrieking] - f*ck me, that's cold, brother. - Hey, I'm good. - I don't wanna do it. [contestant clapping] - I flew all the way from\nAmerica to here just for this. - Jimmy, how many centimetres in between the start and the end? - Bro, what the f*ck's a centimetre? - How many, how, feet? - Inches. - Bro, speak English. [contestant laughing] - See how I still have my shoes on? - Yeah-\n- That's how confident I am- - Yeah! [cheering] - that I'm about to crush this. [contestants cheering] - Okay.\n- We'll see, mate. - I rate 'em, you know. If I had that many subs,\nthere's no way I'd do this. [contestants laughing] - 3. - 2. 1. Go! [board sliding] - Wait. [contestants cheering] - All right, whoa.\n[indistinct yelling] - La la la la. La la la la. Hey hey hey. Goodbye. [contestants laughing] [buzzer sounding] - It's so cold. - [indistinct]...you did that. - The wet shoes. - The wet shoes. - My balls. It's so freezing. - Come on, Harry. - Come on, Harry. - If there's one man that\ncan save the Sidemen. [contestants yelling] [board sliding] - For f*ck's sake. [contestants laughing] [buzzer sounding] - That moment of realisation. [contestants clapping] - I said pull it back a little bit. - You told me sprint full- - Yeah, but I told you pull it back at the end a little. - If you get it, we win. [contestants booing] - Oh, no. - No way, bro. - No way, no way. - Bro, why don't we\n[indistinct] this sh*t? [contestants laughing] - All right, stop it. You\ngotta take it. Take it. [contestants laughing] - Jesus Christ.\n- Good boy. [contestants laughing and clapping] - Hey, wait, wait, wait. [contestants laughing] - Man saw Jesus. - Buddy. Hey take, here have my towel. Have my towel. Did you give up on life for a second? - What happened? - You just, you went like this and instead of coming\nup, you just went down. - It was so cold, I think my\nbrain turned off for a second. - Oh, Vik, I beg you, just do it. - Vik, just do it, please. - I beg Vik does it. - He's gone toilet to lighten his weight. - We ready? - Go Vik!\n[indistinct yelling] - Go Vik. - Let me get a tall glass of Vik. [board sliding]\n- What. What. What? [indistinct cheering]\n- Vik! Vik! - Ooooh! - Yes. - I want you to know, Vik,\nI'm not gonna enjoy this. - Oh wow. The tape is\nhere. He did not make it. He was about a solid foot away. - Jimmy, do you wanna help me? - Yes.\n- Yeah. - Wait, here, let me do the honours. - Why make it painful? No! Why? - Huh? - Oh no! [contestants groaning] - Hey, tease him. - Ooooh! - Alright, this time for real. - Naughty, naughty. - Whoa...whoa! [contestants cheering and clapping] - Ahh! - Oh man. [Vik grunting] - For the love of God. Someone do it. - Nolan you got this.\n- You got this. - You good?\n- Come on, buddy. [contestants booing] - No chance-\n- That's a determined- [board sliding] - Oh. - Hey! No, no, no.\n[indistinct groaning] - Nah, nah, nah- Come on, buddy. - I'll let you put yourself in. Go on. Now you put yourself in, Nolan. - Bye! [Nolan groaning]\n[contestants laughing] - Oh, sh*t. - Oh, that is freezing. [contestants laughing] - That innocent \"bye\". - I regret this, so much. - Just stand up here, look\ndown the barrel of the gun. [contestant laughing] There's nothing bad about it, man. - All right, let's see it. - Simon, save us again. - Minter them. Go on. - Hate is my big biggest\nmotivation, pussy. - Oooh... [clapping and chanting] [chanting speeds up] - Yeah, I like it. - He's done it. - He's short. He's short.\nI'm gonna go push him in. - f*ck, Simon. [groaning and booing]\n- I'm sorry! - Holy sh*t, why are you so much harder to push than Vik? - I hate the Sidemen. I hate all of you. - I don't wanna be pushed\nin by the other team. - I just like torturing the boys. - This is horrible. - Here, help me push him over. [contestant screaming] - This is why it's my job, Jimmy. [buzzer sounding]\n[Simon groaning] [contestants clapping] - I don't wanna do this. - I give that a 10. - Someone's gotta do this, man. - Alright, let's do this. - All right, Tareq. Let's see it. [board sliding]\n- He's off. [indistinct chattering] - I think he's done it. - I think he did! [contestants screaming and clapping] - Let's freaking go! - Did we do it? - I love you! - Even though we won, I think we should still push Tareq in. Come on, come one, come on. [contestants laughing] - Thumbnail this. - All right. - Wait, wait, don't hold this.\nThat your sh*t thumbnail.

welcome to an introduction to object oriented programming in this course we will be getting into what object-oriented programming means as well as going over its four main principles this course will assume that you have some knowledge of programming before hopping in if that's not the case i would suggest checking out our introduction to programming video which will be linked in the description that video will give you information on the basics of programming that are necessary to be able to understand more advanced topics such as those covered in this video for this lecture we will be exploring object oriented programming in a manner that will be applicable for its use in any programming language in which it is supported examples will be used to explain the concept being discussed however they will be explained well enough that specific knowledge of the language being used in the example will not be necessary with that being said let's get into it in this first section we will be going over what object oriented programming actually is in order to understand what object-oriented programming is it's best to first understand what objects are and in order to do that it's best to first understand what primitive data types are so let's start there primitive data types are exactly what they sound like variables that store single simple values examples of such primitive types are the byte int float double boolean and char these primitive types only act to store a single piece of data of a certain kind and for a while when programming was still developing this was just fine many programs being written at the time weren't complex by today's standards thus programmers could get away with only using these primitive types however as programs became larger and more complex primitive data types weren't really cutting it anymore programmers began to want to group variables of similar type together why would this be useful well to serve as an example let's imagine you are trying to program a chess game when programming a knight into the game there are plenty of variables that you will need in order for the piece to work how it should for example you would need a position variable to keep track of where the knight is additionally you would need a boolean to represent whether the piece has been captured or not because if it has you would not want it to show up nor should you be able to move with it you may also need a variable to represent which color the knight is so that the game can treat it correctly these are just a few of the variables that you would need for one piece and you would need one of each of these variables for each piece on the board each of which would contain different data clearly it would be easiest if you could group all of the variables related to say one of your knights together so that you may deal with them as one entity additionally you may want to group your two knights together as they behave similarly you then may want to group the pieces of each side together as they would be treated differently in reference to each other in essence grouping related variables together is almost necessary when it comes to complex programs this is where the struct or structure came in in c the structure is similar to an array if you don't know what an array is i'd suggest you check out either our introduction to programming course for an overview or our data structure series for a more in-depth look at both arrays and many other data structures both arrays and structures allow the programmer to store several pieces of data together however structures vary from arrays in that structures allow the programmer to store data of different types together for instance whereas an array would allow you to store only ins or only strings using a structure you could store ins and strings together along with other data types a structure can even store other structures within it a structure can be very useful in the earlier chess example because you could store all of the useful pieces of data related to the knight in one structure that represents that knight you could then store your knight structures together in one structure that represents all of the knights and so on the structure allowed such grouping to take place beyond what arrays were capable of the structure is in many ways the precursor to the object which of course object oriented programming is oriented around the main issue with using a structure in this way and an issue that objects would come to remedy was that you could not define functions within a structure you could only reference them when object-oriented programming came along objects allowed you to store data of all kinds together and additionally define and store functions now before we go much further i should get into exactly what objects are objects are instances of a class and a class is basically a template for an object this may seem like a circular way of looking at these concepts but allow me to explain let's say i define a night class in this class i would define and store data that is common of all knights this would be mainly the way that knights are able to move thus in this class i would define a function that uses the knight's current position to return squares that the knight can move to i may also define a position variable as well as a color variable but i would not initialize them when it comes to specific things such as variables that each object under the class in this case each night would have different data for it's best to define them when i create the object rather than in the class itself for instance each of the four knights that begin in a game of chess start on different squares than one another initializing the position variable in the night class would imply that you want each knight object created from this class to begin with the same position which you do not however each of the knights would behave the same in terms of the squares it could move to based on their position and thus it is best to define a move function in the class rather than repeating the same function definition in each object that i create when creating a night object you initialize its attributes or its variables and its methods or its functions to contain information specific to that night whereas the night class represents any given night a night object represents one night in particular essentially object-oriented programming is the best tool us programmers have right now to create complex programs by grouping together related data and functions throughout the course of this video we are going to be getting into detail into how all of this works using the four main principles of object-oriented programming those being encapsulation abstraction inheritance and polymorphism this next section is going to be focusing on the first of the four main principles of object-oriented programming encapsulation encapsulation refers to bundling data along with methods that can operate on that data within a class essentially it is the idea of hiding data within a class that anything outside that class cannot directly interact with that is not to say that they are unable to interact with the separate object's attributes at all however instead members of other classes looking to interact with the attributes of an object should only be able to do so through that class's methods in practice one way this tends to work is by creating getting and setting methods these methods act to either get information from an object or set attributes to different values for instance think back to the chess example from the previous section if i was moving one piece and i wanted to determine whether it was able to capture another piece i would need to define a dot get method associated with each piece that returns the piece's color in this case piece dot get color this way i could check the color of any piece from anywhere in my code without having to access the internal attributes of said pieces this allows us to retrieve the information from where it is defined additionally this makes it easiest to keep track of attributes that depend on one another for example if i was programming a game i may have two different attributes for the player's health maxhealth and current health when the character levels up i may have their max health increase as well when this happens i would want the current health to be set to the maximum health instead of changing both of these values directly i can define the set max health method such that the current health is also set to the maximum health once the maximum health has increased furthermore these setting methods allow values to be validated for instance if current health is not able to exceed maximum health then i would have the set current health method check if current health would be greater to maximum health before making the change finally you may want some values to be read only from outside a class which means you would only define a getter method and not a center method for another example let's look back at chess when dealing with a piece's position you would want to keep track of its rank or its row and its file or its column when the piece moves you may think it would be okay to just set piece.rank and piece.file to new values however as discussed above this is not the best way to handle it it would be better to define a ps.move function that takes the intended new position and checks if that is indeed a valid move the piece would not be able to move if say the new location is off the board a piece of the same color is already on that square or making such a move would put the king of the same color in check additionally other methods may be called from this move method for instance one that captures an enemy piece if it was on that square or one that puts the enemy king in check were the pieces attributes just to be directly changed you could end up in a strange situation where illegal moves are played and pieces occupy the same square essentially getter methods allowing validation can be very useful encapsulation is useful for a variety of reasons as we just went over it is best to not allow anything external to directly edit an object's attributes this is especially true when working on large and complex programs where you may want individual pieces of the program to work well without requiring them to rely on every other section of the code in this way preventing each piece of your code from referencing and requiring knowledge of the inner workings of each other section of code is very important to keep your program from becoming completely entangled in itself this is an idea we will touch upon in future sections to come but for now it's best to understand that information hiding that is keeping one class from being able to directly access the data of another class is important to keep control of your program and reducing its overall complexity overall encapsulation is a vital component of object-oriented programming that allows the programmer to maintain control of their data and to keep their program from ending up in any unwanted states in this next section we are going to be discussing the next of the four main principles of object-oriented programming abstraction abstraction refers to the idea of only showing essential details and hiding everything else this idea is present in everyday life when you drive your car there are some things you need to understand about you need to understand how the steering wheel steers the car and how the gas and brake pedals work you also need to know how much gas your car has and that it needs gas to work these are necessary details for you to be able to drive the car properly however the exact way that the car works internally isn't something that most people need to concern themselves with how the gas reacts in the engine and how that translates into the car moving forward really isn't important while you are driving your car all that matters is that you know it will work this way whoever built the car had to worry about how exactly the car would work so that you don't have to this idea extends to object-oriented programming the classes you create should act like your car users of your classes should not worry about the exact inner details of said classes this idea is similar to that of encapsulation that we discussed in the previous section earlier we mentioned how you should not have classes directly interact with the data stored within other classes rather have them use the classes methods to access their data this idea is especially important when you want to work on your program incrementally where you focus on one class at a time and ensure that it works this is a very useful approach as it can be difficult for you to focus in the big picture while programming and splitting up your project into smaller chunks can make it much more manageable furthermore programs nowadays are vast and complex to the point where multiple programmers tend to work on one project in this case it's best if the section that you are working on is able to function without knowledge of the inner workings of your colleague section to achieve this it's best to think of your program in terms of interface and implementation the interface refers to the ways that sections of code are able to communicate with one another this is typically done through methods that each class is able to access the exact implementation of these methods or how the methods are coded should be hidden within the class and not accessible from the outside think of this like the car the other classes are able to turn the wheel and push the gas and they know what the outcome should be without caring about exactly how this gets done let's return to the chess example that we've been using throughout the video let's say that you are working on making the night work as it should and a fellow programmer is working in the king class in order to effectively work together you need to agree on an interface with which these pieces are able to communicate in this case say that you are working on making the knight unable to move if your king is in check as the programmer of the night class you make the knight use the king's getter method that will let the knight know whether or not the king is in check if it is then you make it so the knight is not able to move unless it is able to put the king out of check as you program the night class you should not be concerned with how the king is determining whether or not it is in check the king's method that tells the knight whether or not it is in check is part of the interface but how exactly it does that is part of the implementation this manner of only allowing the classes to interact through a predetermined interface prevents different pieces of the program from becoming completely coupled together if the night class has to look into the king class in order to make a determination then it is reliant on the king class being set up in a certain way in order to function if the king clash is changed or reorganized or its data is renamed then the night class would no longer work and it too would have to be changed assuming the rest of the program was coded in this way then many other classes would also have to be modified creating a set interface through which classes can interact with one another ensures that each individual piece can be changed without creating a ripple effect that causes the entire program to have the change in response overall it's best to keep in mind abstraction when writing object oriented code as it allows the program to be worked on incrementally and prevents it from becoming completely entangled in itself and very complex determine specific points of contact that can act as the interface between classes and only worry about the implementation behind it when working on that section this next section will be tackling inheritance the third of the main principles of object oriented programming inheritance is the principle that allows you to derive classes from other classes classes can inherit certain methods and attributes from another class we will get into exactly what this means in a moment but first let's look at an example let's say you are programming a game in this game the player has access to weapons to fight their enemies to begin you may establish a weapons class this class would contain many of the pertinent attributes and methods common to weapons for instance an attribute that represents the damage that the weapon deals and a method that deals damage to an opponent when called you then would want some more classes to represent specific weapons such as a sword or a club these classes would act differently from one another as swords and clubs have certain different attributes such as a sword being made for cutting whereas a club is blunt these differences would be represented in different values for their attributes as well as possibly different attributes altogether however they do share much of the same behavior as they are both members of the weapons class in this case the weapon class would be the superclass and the sword and club classes that extend the weapon class would be subclasses in relation to it many of the attributes and methods associated with the weapon class would also be present in its subclasses any given sword or club would also want access to the methods that allow them to deal damage as well as the attributes that detail how much and what type of damage they deal the class hierarchy does not tend to be so small however as in most cases there are many more layers than just one superclass and a couple of subclasses the weapon class may be a subclass to a broader items class which could contain many other subclasses with subclasses of their own additionally you may include a wider variety of weapons than just swords and clubs as well as multiple types of swords that would require different behaviors and thus their own subclasses when you are writing object-oriented code many of the classes you create will fit somewhere in the broader class hierarchy which acts as a web of classes with different relationships to one another the next important topic to cover in terms of inheritance is the access modifiers that change which classes access which attributes methods or even classes as a whole there are three main access modifiers that we will be discussing public private and protected let's begin with the public modifier public is probably the most simple of the modifiers a public member or class can be accessed from anywhere this includes any superclasses subclasses or anywhere else in the program this is very useful when you need to have access from a wide variety of places in your program to better understand this modifier and those to come look to the example class hierarchy on screen that represents different foods for each example the member in question will be defined in the fruit class green classes have access and red classes do not as you can see a public member being defined in this class or anywhere else can be accessed from anywhere in your program next we have the private modifier private members can only be accessed from within the same class that the member is defined this is best to use if you do not need this information accessed from anywhere else in the program additionally this allows you to create other private members of the same name in separate classes which will not conflict with one another due to their private access modifier as you can see on the example class hierarchy a private member defined in the fruit class can only be accessed inside the fruit class we then have the protected modifier a protected variable can be accessed from within the class it is defined as well as any subclasses of that class essentially protected variables are private to the class hierarchy that they are defined in this can be seen in the example class hierarchy right now in this final section we will be covering the final of the four main principles polymorphism polymorphism describes methods that are able to take on many forms there are two types of polymorphism the first one is what is called dynamic polymorphism dynamic polymorphism occurs during run time when the program is being executed this describes when a method signature is present in both a subclass and a superclass the methods share the same parameters but have separate implementation in this case the subclasses implementation of the method overrides the superclasses let's go over an example let's say you are writing a program to represent many different types of cars in a class hierarchy at the top of the hierarchy you may have the generic car class you then may create a sports car class as a subclass of the car class you then may create a dot drive method in both of the classes in each of the classes the dot drive function will take a double representing the number of miles you would like the car to drive and the car's gas attribute will be decreased by the pertinent amount in the car class the dot drive function may cause the car's gas to decrease by 0.04 gallons per mile whereas the sports car class may instead have its gas decreased by 0.02 gallons per mile it drives if you create an instance of a sports car called my sports car the sports car implementation of the dot drive method will override the generic car version of the dot drive method therefore my sportscar.drive will decrease my sports car's gas attribute by 0.02 gallons per mile however were you to create an instance of the car class called my car my car.drive would instead decrease my car's gas by 0.04 gallons per mile this is an example of dynamic polymorphism as the implementation of a method signature can change depending on which level in the class hierarchy that it is called this works this way because the form of the method that is called is decided dynamically as the program is run this idea can be extended across the class hierarchy in more layers than just two you could add more subclasses representing different types of sports cars with their own.drive methods with different implementations and creating an instance of each of these subclasses would use their own implementation of the dot drive method one call the main benefit of dynamic polymorphism is that it allows you to write methods in the superclass without having to include ifs and outshifts to account for exactly which subclass is being used when the method is called the second type of polymorphism is static polymorphism static polymorphism occurs during compile time rather than run time this refers to when multiple methods with the same name are defined in the same class in this case the methods are differentiated by their arguments either they take a different number of parameters they take parameters of different types or they take parameters in a different order than one another this is known as method overloading despite the names of the methods being the same they have different method signatures due to their differences in the parameters that they accept to better understand this let's go back to the car example let's say that you are working within the car class in this class you are looking to create three different drive methods the first drive methods argument accepts one integer and one string as parameters say speed and destination for clarity we will refer to this one as drive method one however keep in mind that its method name is just drive for drive method 2 we will set its argument to accept two integers for instance distance and speed finally in drive method 3 we will have it accept a string first for destination and then an integer for speed this differs from drive method 1 in that drive method 1's parameters are in reverse order compared to drive method threes in each of these three example methods the method signature is different despite the methods having the same name therefore the computer is able to tell the methods apart when the program is being compiled for example where i to call mycar.drive45 work drive method 1 would be called as the argument given indicates that this is the method i would like to call furthermore my car.drive 1560 would call drive method 2 and my call.drive school 30 would call drive method three when implementing method overloading the different methods tend to have separate but similar effects despite drive method one and drive method three taking the same parameters it is likely that their implementation would be different and thus would achieve separate effects otherwise there would be no reason to have both methods keep in mind that method overloading can cause trouble if you do not keep straight which of the methods implementations you would like to execute and what form of the argument is required to do so normally if you call a method with too many parameters or parameters of the incorrect type then the program will throw an error and you will be able to fix the issue however if you mistake the methods argument in such a way that one of the other methods with the same name is called instead then you may not even be aware that you made a mistake overall polymorphism simply allows methods to take on many different forms it can be very useful in that it allows methods of the same name to exist both in the same class and in different classes however you must be careful to ensure that you are calling the correct form of the method that you want so your program can function as intended that does it for polymorphism and with the end of polymorphism the final of the four main principles comes the end of this video on an

introduction to object oriented programming in this course we will be getting into what object-oriented programming means as well as going over its four main principles this course will assume that you have some knowledge of programming before hopping in if that's not the case i would suggest checking out our introduction to programming video which will be linked in the description that video will give you information on the basics of programming that are necessary to be able to understand more advanced topics such as those covered in this video for this lecture we will be exploring object oriented programming in a manner that will be applicable for its use in any programming language in which it is supported examples will be used to explain the concept being discussed however they will be explained well enough that specific knowledge of the language being used in the example will not be necessary with that being said let's get into it in this first section we will be going over what object oriented programming actually is in order to understand what object-oriented programming is it's best to first understand what objects are and in order to do that it's best to first understand what primitive data types are so let's start there primitive data types are exactly what they sound like variables that store single simple values examples of such primitive types are the byte int float double boolean and char these primitive types only act to store a single piece of data of a certain kind and for a while when programming was still developing this was just fine many programs being written at the time weren't complex by today's standards thus programmers could get away with only using these primitive types however as programs became larger and more complex primitive data types weren't really cutting it anymore programmers began to want to group variables of similar type together why would this be useful well to serve as an example let's imagine you are trying to program a chess game when programming a knight into the game there are plenty of variables that you will need in order for the piece to work how it should for example you would need a position variable to keep track of where the knight is additionally you would need a boolean to represent whether the piece has been captured or not because if it has you would not want it to show up nor should you be able to move with it you may also need a variable to represent which color the knight is so that the game can treat it correctly these are just a few of the variables that you would need for one piece and you would need one of each of these variables for each piece on the board each of which would contain different data clearly it would be easiest if you could group all of the variables related to say one of your knights together so that you may deal with them as one entity additionally you may want to group your two knights together as they behave similarly you then may want to group the pieces of each side together as they would be treated differently in reference to each other in essence grouping related variables together is almost necessary when it comes to complex programs this is where the struct or structure came in in c the structure is similar to an array if you don't know what an array is i'd suggest you check out either our introduction to programming course for an overview or our data structure series for a more in-depth look at both arrays and many other data structures both arrays and structures allow the programmer to store several pieces of data together however structures vary from arrays in that structures allow the programmer to store data of different types together for instance whereas an array would allow you to store only ins or only strings using a structure you could store ins and strings together along with other data types a structure can even store other structures within it a structure can be very useful in the earlier chess example because you could store all of the useful pieces of data related to the knight in one structure that represents that knight you could then store your knight structures together in one structure that represents all of the knights and so on the structure allowed such grouping to take place beyond what arrays were capable of the structure is in many ways the precursor to the object which of course object oriented programming is oriented around the main issue with using a structure in this way and an issue that objects would come to remedy was that you could not define functions within a structure you could only reference them when object-oriented programming came along objects allowed you to store data of all kinds together and additionally define and store functions now before we go much further i should get into exactly what objects are objects are instances of a class and a class is basically a template for an object this may seem like a circular way of looking at these concepts but allow me to explain let's say i define a night class in this class i would define and store data that is common of all knights this would be mainly the way that knights are able to move thus in this class i would define a function that uses the knight's current position to return squares that the knight can move to i may also define a position variable as well as a color variable but i would not initialize them when it comes to specific things such as variables that each object under the class in this case each night would have different data for it's best to define them when i create the object rather than in the class itself for instance each of the four knights that begin in a game of chess start on different squares than one another initializing the position variable in the night class would imply that you want each knight object created from this class to begin with the same position which you do not however each of the knights would behave the same in terms of the squares it could move to based on their position and thus it is best to define a move function in the class rather than repeating the same function definition in each object that i create when creating a night object you initialize its attributes or its variables and its methods or its functions to contain information specific to that night whereas the night class represents any given night a night object represents one night in particular essentially object-oriented programming is the best tool us programmers have right now to create complex programs by grouping together related data and functions throughout the course of this video we are going to be getting into detail into how all of this works using the four main principles of object-oriented programming those being encapsulation abstraction inheritance and polymorphism this next section is going to be focusing on the first of the four main principles of object-oriented programming encapsulation encapsulation refers to bundling data along with methods that can operate on that data within a class essentially it is the idea of hiding data within a class that anything outside that class cannot directly interact with that is not to say that they are unable to interact with the separate object's attributes at all however instead members of other classes looking to interact with the attributes of an object should only be able to do so through that class's methods in practice one way this tends to work is by creating getting and setting methods these methods act to either get information from an object or set attributes to different values for instance think back to the chess example from the previous section if i was moving one piece and i wanted to determine whether it was able to capture another piece i would need to define a dot get method associated with each piece that returns the piece's color in this case piece dot get color this way i could check the color of any piece from anywhere in my code without having to access the internal attributes of said pieces this allows us to retrieve the information from where it is defined additionally this makes it easiest to keep track of attributes that depend on one another for example if i was programming a game i may have two different attributes for the player's health maxhealth and current health when the character levels up i may have their max health increase as well when this happens i would want the current health to be set to the maximum health instead of changing both of these values directly i can define the set max health method such that the current health is also set to the maximum health once the maximum health has increased furthermore these setting methods allow values to be validated for instance if current health is not able to exceed maximum health then i would have the set current health method check if current health would be greater to maximum health before making the change finally you may want some values to be read only from outside a class which means you would only define a getter method and not a center method for another example let's look back at chess when dealing with a piece's position you would want to keep track of its rank or its row and its file or its column when the piece moves you may think it would be okay to just set piece.rank and piece.file to new values however as discussed above this is not the best way to handle it it would be better to define a ps.move function that takes the intended new position and checks if that is indeed a valid move the piece would not be able to move if say the new location is off the board a piece of the same color is already on that square or making such a move would put the king of the same color in check additionally other methods may be called from this move method for instance one that captures an enemy piece if it was on that square or one that puts the enemy king in check were the pieces attributes just to be directly changed you could end up in a strange situation where illegal moves are played and pieces occupy the same square essentially getter methods allowing validation can be very useful encapsulation is useful for a variety of reasons as we just went over it is best to not allow anything external to directly edit an object's attributes this is especially true when working on large and complex programs where you may want individual pieces of the program to work well without requiring them to rely on every other section of the code in this way preventing each piece of your code from referencing and requiring knowledge of the inner workings of each other section of code is very important to keep your program from becoming completely entangled in itself this is an idea we will touch upon in future sections to come but for now it's best to understand that information hiding that is keeping one class from being able to directly access the data of another class is important to keep control of your program and reducing its overall complexity overall encapsulation is a vital component of object-oriented programming that allows the programmer to maintain control of their data and to keep their program from ending up in any unwanted states in this next section we are going to be discussing the next of the four main principles of object-oriented programming abstraction abstraction refers to the idea of only showing essential details and hiding everything else this idea is present in everyday life when you drive your car there are some things you need to understand about you need to understand how the steering wheel steers the car and how the gas and brake pedals work you also need to know how much gas your car has and that it needs gas to work these are necessary details for you to be able to drive the car properly however the exact way that the car works internally isn't something that most people need to concern themselves with how the gas reacts in the engine and how that translates into the car moving forward really isn't important while you are driving your car all that matters is that you know it will work this way whoever built the car had to worry about how exactly the car would work so that you don't have to this idea extends to object-oriented programming the classes you create should act like your car users of your classes should not worry about the exact inner details of said classes this idea is similar to that of encapsulation that we discussed in the previous section earlier we mentioned how you should not have classes directly interact with the data stored within other classes rather have them use the classes methods to access their data this idea is especially important when you want to work on your program incrementally where you focus on one class at a time and ensure that it works this is a very useful approach as it can be difficult for you to focus in the big picture while programming and splitting up your project into smaller chunks can make it much more manageable furthermore programs nowadays are vast and complex to the point where multiple programmers tend to work on one project in this case it's best if the section that you are working on is able to function without knowledge of the inner workings of your colleague section to achieve this it's best to think of your program in terms of interface and implementation the interface refers to the ways that sections of code are able to communicate with one another this is typically done through methods that each class is able to access the exact implementation of these methods or how the methods are coded should be hidden within the class and not accessible from the outside think of this like the car the other classes are able to turn the wheel and push the gas and they know what the outcome should be without caring about exactly how this gets done let's return to the chess example that we've been using throughout the video let's say that you are working on making the night work as it should and a fellow programmer is working in the king class in order to effectively work together you need to agree on an interface with which these pieces are able to communicate in this case say that you are working on making the knight unable to move if your king is in check as the programmer of the night class you make the knight use the king's getter method that will let the knight know whether or not the king is in check if it is then you make it so the knight is not able to move unless it is able to put the king out of check as you program the night class you should not be concerned with how the king is determining whether or not it is in check the king's method that tells the knight whether or not it is in check is part of the interface but how exactly it does that is part of the implementation this manner of only allowing the classes to interact through a predetermined interface prevents different pieces of the program from becoming completely coupled together if the night class has to look into the king class in order to make a determination then it is reliant on the king class being set up in a certain way in order to function if the king clash is changed or reorganized or its data is renamed then the night class would no longer work and it too would have to be changed assuming the rest of the program was coded in this way then many other classes would also have to be modified creating a set interface through which classes can interact with one another ensures that each individual piece can be changed without creating a ripple effect that causes the entire program to have the change in response overall it's best to keep in mind abstraction when writing object oriented code as it allows the program to be worked on incrementally and prevents it from becoming completely entangled in itself and very complex determine specific points of contact that can act as the interface between classes and only worry about the implementation behind it when working on that section this next section will be tackling inheritance the third of the main principles of object oriented programming inheritance is the principle that allows you to derive classes from other classes classes can inherit certain methods and attributes from another class we will get into exactly what this means in a moment but first let's look at an example let's say you are programming a game in this game the player has access to weapons to fight their enemies to begin you may establish a weapons class this class would contain many of the pertinent attributes and methods common to weapons for instance an attribute that represents the damage that the weapon deals and a method that deals damage to an opponent when called you then would want some more classes to represent specific weapons such as a sword or a club these classes would act differently from one another as swords and clubs have certain different attributes such as a sword being made for cutting whereas a club is blunt these differences would be represented in different values for their attributes as well as possibly different attributes altogether however they do share much of the same behavior as they are both members of the weapons class in this case the weapon class would be the superclass and the sword and club classes that extend the weapon class would be subclasses in relation to it many of the attributes and methods associated with the weapon class would also be present in its subclasses any given sword or club would also want access to the methods that allow them to deal damage as well as the attributes that detail how much and what type of damage they deal the class hierarchy does not tend to be so small however as in most cases there are many more layers than just one superclass and a couple of subclasses the weapon class may be a subclass to a broader items class which could contain many other subclasses with subclasses of their own additionally you may include a wider variety of weapons than just swords and clubs as well as multiple types of swords that would require different behaviors and thus their own subclasses when you are writing object-oriented code many of the classes you create will fit somewhere in the broader class hierarchy which acts as a web of classes with different relationships to one another the next important topic to cover in terms of inheritance is the access modifiers that change which classes access which attributes methods or even classes as a whole there are three main access modifiers that we will be discussing public private and protected let's begin with the public modifier public is probably the most simple of the modifiers a public member or class can be accessed from anywhere this includes any superclasses subclasses or anywhere else in the program this is very useful when you need to have access from a wide variety of places in your program to better understand this modifier and those to come look to the example class hierarchy on screen that represents different foods for each example the member in question will be defined in the fruit class green classes have access and red classes do not as you can see a public member being defined in this class or anywhere else can be accessed from anywhere in your program next we have the private modifier private members can only be accessed from within the same class that the member is defined this is best to use if you do not need this information accessed from anywhere else in the program additionally this allows you to create other private members of the same name in separate classes which will not conflict with one another due to their private access modifier as you can see on the example class hierarchy a private member defined in the fruit class can only be accessed inside the fruit class we then have the protected modifier a protected variable can be accessed from within the class it is defined as well as any subclasses of that class essentially protected variables are private to the class hierarchy that they are defined in this can be seen in the example class hierarchy right now in this final section we will be covering the final of the four main principles polymorphism polymorphism describes methods that are able to take on many forms there are two types of polymorphism the first one is what is called dynamic polymorphism dynamic polymorphism occurs during run time when the program is being executed this describes when a method signature is present in both a subclass and a superclass the methods share the same parameters but have separate implementation in this case the subclasses implementation of the method overrides the superclasses let's go over an example let's say you are writing a program to represent many different types of cars in a class hierarchy at the top of the hierarchy you may have the generic car class you then may create a sports car class as a subclass of the car class you then may create a dot drive method in both of the classes in each of the classes the dot drive function will take a double representing the number of miles you would like the car to drive and the car's gas attribute will be decreased by the pertinent amount in the car class the dot drive function may cause the car's gas to decrease by 0.04 gallons per mile whereas the sports car class may instead have its gas decreased by 0.02 gallons per mile it drives if you create an instance of a sports car called my sports car the sports car implementation of the dot drive method will override the generic car version of the dot drive method therefore my sportscar.drive will decrease my sports car's gas attribute by 0.02 gallons per mile however were you to create an instance of the car class called my car my car.drive would instead decrease my car's gas by 0.04 gallons per mile this is an example of dynamic polymorphism as the implementation of a method signature can change depending on which level in the class hierarchy that it is called this works this way because the form of the method that is called is decided dynamically as the program is run this idea can be extended across the class hierarchy in more layers than just two you could add more subclasses representing different types of sports cars with their own.drive methods with different implementations and creating an instance of each of these subclasses would use their own implementation of the dot drive method one call the main benefit of dynamic polymorphism is that it allows you to write methods in the superclass without having to include ifs and outshifts to account for exactly which subclass is being used when the method is called the second type of polymorphism is static polymorphism static polymorphism occurs during compile time rather than run time this refers to when multiple methods with the same name are defined in the same class in this case the methods are differentiated by their arguments either they take a different number of parameters they take parameters of different types or they take parameters in a different order than one another this is known as method overloading despite the names of the methods being the same they have different method signatures due to their differences in the parameters that they

just drive for drive method 2 we will set its argument to accept two integers for instance distance and speed finally in drive method 3 we will have it accept a string first for destination and then an integer for speed this differs from drive method 1 in that drive method 1's parameters are in reverse order compared to drive method threes in each of these three example methods the method signature is different despite the methods having the same name therefore the computer is able to tell the methods apart when the program is being compiled for example where i to call mycar.drive45 work drive method 1 would be called as the argument given indicates that this is the method i would like to call furthermore my car.drive 1560 would call drive method 2 and my call.drive school 30

parameters it is likely that their implementation would be different and thus would achieve separate effects otherwise there would be no reason to have both methods keep in mind that method

attempting to complete it\nwithout falling 200 feet to the ground. Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000.

[contestants clapping and cheering] - Woo! Yes! - Team Mr. Beast is going first. Who is going to do the challenge? - I'll do it. I don't know. [contestants clapping and cheering] - The first round is\ncalled Honeycomb Maze. - You must find the exit to the maze without getting stopped by the bees. - And the team with the fastest total time wins. Once you walk in, I'm\ngonna start the timer. - Oh, God.\n- Are you ready? - Goofy Goobers, you good? - We're ready.\n- Yeah! [contestant laughing] - Look at this bee. - 3. 2. 1. Let's go!\n[horn blowing] - Good luck, Jimmy. - Go! He's going! Go! Go right, go right! Keep going! - Why's the bee not moving? - Go right!\n- He's actually elite. [indistinct] This man is moving quick. - What are the bees doing? - Boom! [indistinct yelling] [contestants clapping and cheering] - You know what? This is too easy. [confetti popping] Let's go. - 8.5 seconds.\n- Yes! - I mean, he's done it. He's done it. He's done it. We've got an eight minute\nSidemen Sunday boys. - Oh, you silly, silly boys. You thought you could get rid of me? Well, guess what? Never! It's Ethan, and I'm here to tell you to hit that subscribe button. We are not at 17 million subscribers yet. What are you doing? Click the red button! [fire exploding] - So is Sidemen team going now? - Yeah. - All right. Who's going? [indistinct chattering]\n- Yeah, I'll go. I'll go. - You gotta beat that. 8 seconds. - Oh my gosh. - How am I even gonna beat that? - Were there even bees in there? - Bro, yes and you just\ndodged all of them. [Jimmy laughing] - If JJ finishes it, he'll be lucky. - I think JJ's best option is just brute. - He's going to fight a bee. - Just literally just run. - JJ, are you ready? - Yeah. - You've got a very tough time to beat. 3, 2, 1, go. [horn blowing]\n- Go on, JJ! - He's off. He's off. He's off. - He already ran into one. - Oh. [contestants laughing and cheering] - [Simon Run, JJ, run! - Sounds like he's\nsmashing every damn door. [contestants laughing] - Bro, the door sound effect. [contestants laughing] [contestants screaming and laughing] - He just pushed the bee. - He just shoved the bee. - f*ckin- Fam! - Someone tell him the\nbee's not Logan Paul. - It seems like he's hit every door but the right one.\n- Get off me! No. Ah! Get off me! - He may actually die in this maze. Is there food and water in\nthere? Because he might run out. - Oh my God. [bee buzzing] - It's right there. It's right there. - Oh God! No! - No it wasn't. Bro.\n[indistinct] - He's tried every door at this point. - We're coming up on the clock. - He thinks he's tried every door. - Oh my God. - Wait, wait, wait, he\njust kicked the door open. - That wasn't the right door,\nbut I still stopped the timer. - Go back in!\n- That's not the exit. - Go back in.\n- Go back in. - I mean, I technically stopped the timer. They don't have to know that. And, okay. He's broken another door.\n- No! - No, go through that one. It's this one. - Stop breaking the doors! - Now he knows where it is. - You're almost there.\nYou've almost got it. There we go. [contestants clapping] - Nice. - We'll give him a participation trophy. - A minute sixteen. - Oh wow. Okay. - No confetti for you. I'm sorry. - Oh... - We should subtract 10 seconds\nfor kicking down a door. That was funny. - Yeah, that's alright.\nLet's give him 56 seconds. - Ah, nice.\n[contestants clapping] - Team Sidemen, Who do you want to compete next? - We need someone smart. - We need our equivalent.

Pressure is gonna be mounting. It's not looking good for the Sidemen. - Maybe this is smart. - Where's the finish line? - No, the bees don't know where he is. - There's a bee there. On the right! - Oh, no, no, no, no, no\nthat bee has seen him. [door hitting wall]\n[Vik screaming] [contestants yelling] - Run Vik. - Get off me. - He might be starting to panic. [Josh chuckling]\n- Get off me! - He might be getting claustrophobic. Go back in- [Vik yelling] [laughing] He came out the entrance. - Well that bee is on him. - He's moving so fast though. - He's getting gang banged by two bees. [Vik yelling] - Yes!\n[contestants cheering] - So Vik, so come on here.\n- Well done, Vik. - It wasn't awful. It wasn't awful. - It just wasn't great.\n- It wasn't awful. - Vikkstar did it in exactly one minute. [contestants slightly clapping] - One minute forty-eight\nseconds versus eight seconds. Chris, you can't possibly screw this up. - Don't say that. - Literally, even if\nyou tried, you couldn't. - I believe in you. Come\non, look at the ground. - Now that I've seen other people do it, how did it take you eight seconds? - All right, Chris, are you ready? - I'm ready, Freddy. - You've only got to beat one\nminute forty eight seconds. - I think I can do it maybe. - 3, 2, 1. Go in.\n[horn blowing] [clapping]\n- Here we go. - Faster! - Oh, there he is. I\nthink he's in the middle. [Chris laughing] - Oh, he's being raped. [Chris screaming] - Oh he's so big. Oh the bees are double teaming him. - Get outta there. - Where do I go? [laughing] Buzz off! - Oh my god, he's getting\nclose. He's getting close. - Keep going, Chris, keep going. - He's gonna find it. - Oh ho ho, no.\n- Yes, yes! [contestants laughing] - Hold him.

What do you think happened?\nIt's team Mr. Beast. - Let's go!\n[contestants cheering] - USA! [confetti popping] [contestants cheering] - The next round is called DoorDash. - Two members of each team must race through a series of doors. - To progress, avoid the three solid wooden doors by finding the fake door. - 3, 2, 1.

[contestants yelling] - Go, go, go, go, go. Win this. Win this.\nThis is it. This is it. - No! - That's a foul. - He won. - Chris just won. - He pushed him through to beat him. [contestants laughing] - It was you, me, me, you. - He pushed him through, but he won. [contestant laughing] - Is Chris alright? [contestants laughing and clapping] - I was just in war. - I put my arm through a wall. - I just pushed you through that one. - I know it's fine. As I dove through, I hit my knee and I was just like, I'm still\nwinning it doesn't matter. [contestants laughing] - You guys are trying\nto lose at this point. [contestants laughing] - Like, what the hell? - Nolan, don't mess up or\nyou're off the channel. - 3.\n- Hold them back. - 2, 1, go. [horn blowing] - Go [indistinct]! [contestants screaming] - Nolan's a genius. - Over here! [indistinct yelling] - Tareq almost flipped through it. Yes! - Right here, Tareq! Push them out of the way.\n- No! [indistinct yelling] - Hold him down. Hold him. [contestants yelling] - Bro. [contestants yelling] - Three in a row. [contestants laughing and yelling] - What the f*ck. - Ooooooh. [contestants laughing] - Nolan got three in a row. - He's a beast!\n- Come here Nolan. - You can't beat me. I'm a Fall Guys champion! - Well, the Sidemen f*ckin' suck. - Bro, he just went\nthrough every right door. - Bro, he got four doors in a row. I didn't even get to a door\nbefore he got through it. - You are being embarrassed\non your own channel. - Our strategy was, I was\nlike, yo, you spearhead, I'll just let you know\nif you messed up or not. - I didn't mess up though.\n- He didn't mess up. He didn't mess up.\n- How?! - You just gonna leave me hanging. - Oh, that was embarrassing. - Hey, buddy.\n[contestant laughing] - They spent half a million\ndollars on this video just for us to come in here and [laughs]. - Sweep the floor. - Like how did you, when you\nlooked at this, for example? - To me it just looks slightly different. - Wait, so Nolan came in first? - Yes. - Who came in second? - That's what I was asking. I was so focused on Nolan. - I'm gonna say it. Not even a competition. - Come on.\n- I knew it was coming. [contestants clapping] - Come on. - There's nothing we can\ndo there.

[contestants laughing] - We felt, we felt bad. - Yeah. - Team Sidemen. - Yeah! - We had to give 'em one.\n- Woo! - I'm keeping the jersey. - Hey. Football is their thing. If we beat them it\nwould've been embarrassing. - I was gonna say, the American sport is when\nyou finally showed up. [contestants laughing] What are you doing? - Let's do baseball or basketball. - Oh no, no, no.\n- Please no. Please no. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - With the score already being 3-1 to Mr. Beast's team, we\nhave to raise the stakes. For this last round, whichever team wins, wins the whole video. - The first person to\nstop in the right place, exactly above the arrow,\nwins for their team. - If you don't go far enough, or you go too far, you get dunked in the pool.

beast and he has just invited me to his top secret youtube warehouse well actually we're currently inside of it and i want to show you guys around so he can get views we're going to show you where his videos are filmed how his videos are edited and then finally how much a ridiculous setup like this actually costs and i'm a little scared because i've never shown anyone around this studio this is gonna be a first time this is gonna be cool come in here is around 50 000 square feet there's no polls or anything so we can just build sets we can do whatever we want you know what's blowing my mind this is not what i associate with youtube you know what's funny that's literally what everyone says when they come in here they're like for youtube one thing i noticed immediately when i walked in is like you clap you hear nothing back yeah except these guys in the back yeah they're working on a video that's exactly right so we soundproof the ceiling on top of that uh you'll probably notice there's hundreds of sprinklers on the ceiling do you have sprinklers because you keep blowing stuff up in here yeah exactly no you could blow up a car there and not have to worry about burning them in the building that's a rare use case scenario in one of our coming up video we need a million dollars these are empty don't try to rob me right now so we're putting ten thousand dollars in a hundred briefcases is there a reason you've settled on this particular model of briefcase does this just not look like ten thousand dollars i don't know it could be maybe more golden [Laughter] okay time to ask jimmy the big question android or iphone obviously iphone steve jobs steve jobs name the person who created android andy rubin okay well i didn't know that we'll keep a tally of every single person we meet in this tour this right here is one of our coming up videos the beauty of having all this space is our old warehouse was basically the size of this room this room feels like there was some havoc yeah there's a lot of havoc there's just like random broken bits of tech and eggs yeah so you should remember that if you show anything bad i'm gonna get egged that was a threat oh you're gonna break tech in front of me yeah yeah i will this was our little hub over here that you would have thought was baller so this is what it looked like when we were filming so you could see all the girls cameras there all the boys cameras there so we could constantly monitor it this is the kind of stuff we don't normally show we had to have six or seven people here monitoring every angle because if they just touch the red line they're out you have to basically set up like 40 cameras so you can monitor every single inch of the line what they're doing on top of content and there's two of them it's a role you don't think about yeah what did you do today i stared at girls for a hundred hours like you might want to refreeze i stared at a red line for a hundred dollars someone's getting a little edgy over here yeah and on top of that you can zoom in as well so we have tons of shots but just zooming into their mouths or whatever they're eating food oh my god like what kind of zoom level do you want to go to the camera room yeah okay james he's curious do you use iphone or android oh two to zero two zeros steve jobs wrapped around the studio is tons of office space multiple floors you'll just see like these are some people planning our next video is that room called boobs i didn't do it all right so this is the camera room yes some videos we use 100 cameras some videos we use 10 some we need to be able to zoom in 100x something we need a hundred vlog cameras for hide and seek there's a lot of weird things in here you want to summon tariq by some of them you're summoning them hey what's up this transition is going to suck this is tariq he's had a camera hello he's going to show us what's going on here i've never seen so much camera gear in my entire life we have 26 fs5s these are the time-lapse cameras that you guys see so every time you see a time-lapse shot this camera is usually hanging somewhere on set capturing it okay what just to give you guys an idea the fs5 was a six thousand dollar camera when it was launched in 2015. these guys have 26 of them five kids 26. let's do the math yeah the total is a lot and then you've got loads of the same lens so the way it works is every single camera lens has a focal length which basically just indicates how zoomed in it is our videos relative to these are very homegrown we film most of them in my bedroom the widest angle we have is like 24 mil and the most telescopic one we have is like a 55mm but these guys when they go wide they go wide this is a 10 millimeter lens which is used to capture the entirety of a massive video set in one shot and then when they want to get close-ups from further away they have a lens here capable of not 50 millimeters or 80 millimeters but 300 millimeters this is a telescope but there's three more key cameras that the mysteries team uses the first being the sony 4k camcorder so we usually use these for run and gun videos slash when we have a lot of night time shots and that's because it has not just actual night vision but also just insane optical image stabilization look how much the lens moves on the inside and then to top it all off there's about 50 gopro cameras in these boxes here and another 50 of what are effectively super high-end security cameras each capable of streaming a live view of their feed so that people in that control center can keep an eye on the video contestants in real time oh and also they have 20 times optical zoom and then the pista resistance this is an fvv drone that looks like you've made it we have an fpv pilot you build this you built it yeah it's actually wild that's something that someone has built themselves is a big part of your filming gear i'm putting you on the spot here all right can you guess the total value of tech in this room i'm about to be so wrong 1.3 million sweet it's been great thank you so much man oh and thank god i'm back tariq sucks i won't leave again i kind of missed you jimmy oh my gosh we're missing a lot of our play buttons we do our videos in tons of languages this is just our english channels this is mr b6 000 so what point did you change it in between 100k and a million apparently but anyways this is missing a lot don't look at it it's ugly do you have iphone or android i don't know which one i have android are you using oh wait so that's one for android one for android you use iphone well i guess a point for both it's 2022 and if you're still buying white boards you are an idiot there's a thing called whiteboard paint you can just draw wherever it doesn't matter it comes off so for us any note that we make we make it a thing to keep it digital you want to keep it online so that anyone can kind of log in and check it do you guys not care about that no no we're wall drawers i grab a water no he took it anyways this is an enormous screen when we got this place someone was like yeah we got free tvs and that was all i was told i don't even shout out to sony get your marketing budget on this it turns out jimmy's free tvs that you find all around this building they're actually sony's new 85-inch 8k hdr smart tvs and they're being used to watch 1080p content fantastic very comfortable that's an ipad holder yeah but does anyone actually use this you tell me and while he's getting comfortable we're going to continue the tour we don't need them what is this for like in the middle of a meeting is someone just going to be like sorry guys hey we're doing a tour i don't mind wait it's too comfortable no no it doesn't what i can't get in were you struggling to get inside that room all you gotta do is just that it picks up the bluetooth on my phone and it recognizes it's me so i can unlock the door so yeah this is my little apartment this is where i live for the most part so you actually sleep in your office of course this is my bed looks like my girlfriend left me a message yes if you want to sleep in my bed i won't stop you okay this is nice okay so in jimmy's fridge yogurt and water what we're potentially launching our own sauce at cheeseburger blur what's on it so they don't get the ingredients the only thing you have to eat them with is yogurt the worst part of my tiny apartment is uh the fridge blocks the tv i'm running out of room i missed that this is an enormous screen but it's above the couch so i don't use it these are all my clothes over here bathroom talk oh really even my bathroom's not off limits bro really we're about to just film the bathroom together so this is a heated toilet seat i'm telling you it will change your life get a heated toilet seat it will make your butt feel great josh yeah he's getting b-roll with my toilet this is kind of my morning routine i get out of bed i walk over here work out and i walk over here i shower and i walk over here i change and i walk over here and i eat it's like a little morning circuit and then i walk out there and i work and right over here is one of the cool rooms we also have a gaming channel and a react channel which we film in here iphone or android on three hold up what phone you use okay it's three well you have two why they're both iphones let's go nevermind good anyways we're actually here to show them the react set so come on in over here so this is where we film all our reacts videos let's react to some tech content let's see it you got to see the best tech video of all time is this like 360 camera wait josh what's going on here we go to video two no it just looks like it was rendered weird was this supposed to happen what is going on is that your cat's bum that's milo nice to meet you milo's butthole oh i know this video this is one of my favorite visions of the future these calendars here oh my gosh you can walk up to it like that so it knows what part of the room you are i love this idea this digital overlay on the real world i do too honestly i'm kind of pissed off we don't already have this could you see yourself using like all this kind of stuff 100 i mean i don't know how to ride a bike so not this i'm just thinking about like pokemon go too oh all right now we're on to our next clip with tesla there's no elon i'm disliking this is some very brave piloting yeah oh my gosh isn't it a tesla the safest car ever made in history remember it survived a crash test and actually broke the crash test dummy do you see teslas as like an art form i just like obviously that they don't run on fossil fuels faster than other cars it has more like amenities but i don't really use any of that the biggest pull to me for tesla is the interior like you sit down you feel like you're being of course if you're a car guy i'm just not who's this guy oh this i need yeah that looks very cool you like sushi right i do no screw this frick roll i don't care that was actually genius i'm calling someone to order them i know you were trying to prank us but i don't care wait i'm buying them hey i need some uh auto stick chopsticks love you you don't probably get much experience with android vents never this is the xiaomi 12s ultra one of its big selling points is the fact that it has the biggest camera sensor and a phone wow this is cool yeah this is crazy love it yeah the coloring's good look at that tell me that doesn't look like a wallpaper i can't say it's better but i can tell you it's how it works it's an interesting take because normally iphone users just kind of shut down android phones and for coming out to beast react studio you get a giant lot of money here you go thanks for coming out all right let's continue the tour android or iphone yes two more android points i hate you guys and this room over here i think you guys will enjoy so it's top secret but i'll let you in right in the back corner of the building of all the rooms in the building i feel like you would appreciate this the most all right so this is the mrb server room the way these guys have set it up is that all the projects that they're ever working on are stored right here on site in this server which means that every single computer in this entire complex is accessing the same set of files at the same time but the cherry on top is that it's configured so that even if you're sitting on the other side of the world you can actually remotely log in and access the editing machines here to use them to edit footage that's stored right here in this server so how much storage would you say you have in this room infinite what do you think the total cost of this room is 400 grand do you use android or iphone you play chess i do play chess on a game of chess now over the few days that i spent with jimmy the one key thing that i've learned about this guy is he takes board games seriously he absolutely came to me in a game of katan the night before chess was my way of making sure i won one back oh my god that was a girl game all right so this is the editing room and i had two things that i wanted to find out here one how fast is mr beast internet oh i see you know what i mean yeah what what upload this you know with footage finding stuff and two if these guys have any special gear to edit with yeah they kind of do the editors who prefer windows they'll be choosing 19 000 hp workstations with 24 core server grade processors and 256 gigabytes of ram and for those who prefer mac a pretty equivalent expect one thousand dollar mac pro wait that's how much they cost yeah feels like we've been in a lot of rooms but this is only part of it there's so many rooms in this building and it's so massive that's what i love about it i feel like i'm getting my steps in and over here is the little kitchen there's festival bars over here you should be eating this it's a very colorful selection of beverages you've never seen unicorn magic honeydew soda it was in there because it was a punishment for a video we don't obviously drink this it's actually really nice yeah so much sugar that i'm literally tearing up so i have an editing question for you actually you've got the most ridiculous camera gear available to you you've got 300 cameras in some videos you just upgraded your cameras actually to new ones that can shoot 8k resolution which i never will because i think it looks too professional yeah so this is the question why is it that after all that you still export in 1080p i don't like the way high quality footage looks you know at the end of the day it's just me and the boys messing around you know we still come up with the videos it's still things that i find fun and i enjoy and i don't ever want things to feel too produced why do you do 8k we do 4k to some extent in the tech genre there's like an expectation that you have good production value of course if i can't take good footage who am i to judge other phones for how good they listen 4k this is in 4k okay but there's a twist here you've come here thinking that jimmy has just one studio he actually has two we've just seen what they call studio c okay and this is studio a this is where it all began this is also where i've heard a lot of mystery secrets are and this is walt hi i'm walt i'm the head of on-site production for mr b's gaming and mr beast reacts there's a whole bunch of lights here yep what lights does mr beast use for his videos they're called sky panels every single one is a seven thousand dollar fixture i'm capable of lighting an entire warehouse on its own honestly that's like at least 10 12 kilos probably [Laughter] now because studio c is becoming the main office that everyone works out of studio a is the one where you find the most exotic items i'm talking like a mini drivable lamborghini giant fake marshmallows from when they tried to recreate willy wonka's chocolate factory and then tubs upon tubs of costumes that they used in their recreation of the squid games so this is the gaming trailer oh yeah iphone or android i am iphone i got a 12 pro max this cabin which is a part of studio a is where the entirety of the mr beast gaming channel is filmed and it's kind of nerd paradise the shelves upon shelves of wonderful and questionable tech items there's a real ice cream machine and there's nerf guns everywhere but then we go deeper inside so this is the office where i kind of currently work out of is this what i think it is yeah it was the retro future the custom made original game boy wow the logo the sesame seeds the pink power button you can change the color on the screen it has that authentic that is wild you can't beat it weirdly that's one of the coolest pieces of tech i've seen so far here we have jimmy's gaming room the main idea with these setups is that they could sit down and then be good to go filming within a minute or two i'm gonna sit down and i'm gonna rate mr b's gaming setup oh good choice of chair you can tell that the entire setup here is just geared around efficiency they've got it to the point that with one tap of this button here all lights can be turned on and off and with the top of this button all the relevant programs that they need to film one of these gaming videos they are loaded and ready in one go including the software to be able to see your own camera view in real time the mouse is really smooth this is the most responsive windows experience i've ever had the keyboard is a membrane keyboard which is normally considered like a tier below but you've done that for noise really yeah intentionally and so given that it's actually actually really nice to type on it doesn't feel bad the keys have nice travel he's done a definite solid with this controller this is my favorite looking xbox controller ever the chrome outlines around each button are nice this is a very good choice of mic and if you're wondering what the pc is that mr beast uses for gaming with an i9 11 900k 32 gigs of ram and an rtx 3090 graphics card hooked up to a 4k 120hz monitor this whole setup would be around 15 000 but that's not the crazy part because there isn't just one of them the entire room has actually been almost 100 cloned four times one for each of the characters in jimmy's videos chandler carl and chris they all have slightly different chairs and keyboards based on their preferences but the core machines behind it are one-to-one so this is the storage worker this is the storage of our house i've been told this is the weirdest place yes you need giant 40-inch touchscreen iphones got those yeah so as you can tell i'm very heavily on to team iphone so this giant iphone it's essentially a real iphone 6s that's casting its screen to an apple tv box screwed into the back that's hooked up to a large tv screen it sounds ridiculous but it works this is wild this is like the one part of it that i i wouldn't have thought actually works yeah i could take a portrait mode all right let's do that yeah i got it i got you i got you there we go there you go left my mark this storage center is just rammed with all the stuff that's been used in past videos that might need to be used in future videos literally anything you can think of tiki torches rubber chickens an even bigger nano leaf light collection then we have even a box full of shockingly realistic babies don't ask me why it's here pretty much all the expensive stuff lies within here as far as like phones to give away it's always apple i think you're just broken i'll scare you a little bit i'm sorry and to wrap up the studio tour i wanted to show him something cool so walk with me boys oh there's a plant there we're doing a video where i put a guy inside of this red circle see that outline around the house and if he survives in there for 100 days straight he wins half a million dollars okay so we've seen studio c we've seen studio a we've seen whatever this is we've got the full price of all the tech inside what is the actual cost of the buildings themselves oh boy the big studio over there was a little over 10 million dollars the old one actually was a church that we renovated that was like probably 1.3 million so okay 11.3 million dollars in buildings yeah everything i don't even want to know the total you know what i just make the best videos possible and sometimes i have to spend money and if you enjoyed this video then a sub to the channel would be he told me to say beastly you might have noticed over the last few months that the entire way that i'm trying to make my videos is changing the way i spend much more time moving between locations and being out and about the way i'm trying to get more interactions with youtube friends and members of the public and how i'm trying to have a clear golden moment in every video a culmination of everything that rewards you the viewer for clicking a lot of this stuff has come from the storytelling through film course that i found on skillshare by a guy called thomas de gea and the thing that really struck me about this is how efficiently you can learn stuff on this platform there's no clickbait there's no ads and it's organized in such a way that you can pick up any new skill in practically any category from animation to marketing start to finish in 30 minutes the first thousand of you to sign up using my code or the link in the description will get a one month free trial of skillshare to get started on that journey", "timestamp":

Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000.

Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000.

Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man.", "timestamp": "2024-06-20 01:15:24"}, {"video_id": "lUzpK0tGFcE", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUzpK0tGFcE", "summary": "**MrBeast's Warehouse and Studio

beast and he has just invited me to his top secret youtube warehouse well actually we're currently inside of it and i want to show you guys around so he can get views we're going to show you where his videos are filmed how his videos are edited and then finally how much a ridiculous setup like this actually costs and i'm a little scared because i've never shown anyone around this studio this is gonna be a first time this is gonna be cool come in here is around 50 000 square feet there's no polls or anything so we can just build sets we can do whatever we want you know what's blowing my mind this is not what i associate with youtube you know what's funny that's literally what everyone says when they come in here they're like for youtube one thing i noticed immediately when i walked in is like you clap you hear nothing back yeah except these guys in the back yeah they're working on a video that's exactly right so we soundproof the ceiling on top of that uh you'll probably notice there's hundreds of sprinklers on the ceiling do you have sprinklers because you keep blowing stuff up in here yeah exactly no you could blow up a car there and not have to worry about burning them in the building that's a rare use case scenario in one of our coming up video we need a million dollars these are empty don't try to rob me right now so we're putting ten thousand dollars in a hundred briefcases is there a reason you've settled on this particular model of briefcase does this just not look like ten thousand dollars i don't know it could be maybe more golden [Laughter] okay time to ask jimmy the big question android or iphone obviously iphone steve jobs steve jobs name the person who created android andy rubin okay well i didn't know that we'll keep a tally of every single person we meet in this tour this right here is one of our coming up videos the beauty of having all this space is our old warehouse was basically the size of this room this room feels like there was some havoc yeah there's a lot of havoc there's just like random broken bits of tech and eggs yeah so you should remember that if you show anything bad i'm gonna get egged that was a threat oh you're gonna break tech in front of me yeah yeah i will this was our little hub over here that you would have thought was baller so this is what it looked like when we were filming so you could see all the girls cameras there all the boys cameras there so we could constantly monitor it this is the kind of stuff we don't normally show we had to have six or seven people here monitoring every angle because if they just touch the red line they're out you have to basically set up like 40 cameras so you can monitor every single inch of the line what they're doing on top of content and there's two of them it's a role you don't think about yeah what did you do today i stared at girls for a hundred hours like you might want to refreeze i stared at a red line for a hundred dollars someone's getting a little edgy over here yeah and on top of that you can zoom in as well so we have tons of shots but just zooming into their mouths or whatever they're eating food oh my god like what kind of zoom level do you want to go to the camera room yeah okay james he's curious do you use iphone or android oh two to zero two zeros steve jobs wrapped around the studio is tons of office space multiple floors you'll just see like these are some people planning our next video is that room called boobs i didn't do it all right so this is the camera room yes some videos we use 100 cameras some videos we use 10 some we need to be able to zoom in 100x something we need a hundred vlog cameras for hide and seek there's a lot of weird things in here you want to summon tariq by some of them you're summoning them hey what's up this transition is going to suck this is tariq he's had a camera hello he's going to show us what's going on here i've never seen so much camera gear in my entire life we have 26 fs5s these are the time-lapse cameras that you guys see so every time you see a time-lapse shot this camera is usually hanging somewhere on set capturing it okay what just to give you guys an idea the fs5 was a six thousand dollar camera when it was launched in 2015. these guys have 26 of them five kids 26. let's do the math yeah the total is a lot and then you've got loads of the same lens so the way it works is every single camera lens has a focal length which basically just indicates how zoomed in it is our videos relative to these are very homegrown we film most of them in my bedroom the widest angle we have is like 24 mil and the most telescopic one we have is like a 55mm but these guys when they go wide they go wide this is a 10 millimeter lens which is used to capture the entirety of a massive video set in one shot and then when they want to get close-ups from further away they have a lens here capable of not 50 millimeters or 80 millimeters but 300 millimeters this is a telescope but there's three more key cameras that the mysteries team uses the first being the sony 4k camcorder so we usually use these for run and gun videos slash when we have a lot of night time shots and that's because it has not just actual night vision but also just insane optical image stabilization look how much the lens moves on the inside and then to top it all off there's about 50 gopro cameras in these boxes here and another 50 of what are effectively super high-end security cameras each capable of streaming a live view of their feed so that people in that control center can keep an eye on the video contestants in real time oh and also they have 20 times optical zoom and then the pista resistance this is an fvv drone that looks like you've made it we have an fpv pilot you build this you built it yeah it's actually wild that's something that someone has built themselves is a big part of your filming gear i'm putting you on the spot here all right can you guess the total value of tech in this room i'm about to be so wrong 1.3 million sweet it's been great thank you so much man oh and thank god i'm back tariq sucks i won't leave again i kind of missed you jimmy oh my gosh we're missing a lot of our play buttons we do our videos in tons of languages this is just our english channels this is mr b6 000 so what point did you change it in between 100k and a million apparently but anyways this is missing a lot don't look at it it's ugly do you have iphone or android i don't know which one i have android are you using oh wait so that's one for android one for android you use iphone well i guess a point for both it's 2022 and if you're still buying white boards you are an idiot there's a thing called whiteboard paint you can just draw wherever it doesn't matter it comes off so for us any note that we make we make it a thing to keep it digital you want to keep it online so that anyone can kind of log in and check it do you guys not care about that no no we're wall drawers i grab a water no he took it anyways this is an enormous screen when we got this place someone was like yeah we got free tvs and that was all i was told i don't even shout out to sony get your marketing budget on this it turns out jimmy's free tvs that you find all around this building they're actually sony's new 85-inch 8k hdr smart tvs and they're being used to watch 1080p content fantastic very comfortable that's an ipad holder yeah but does anyone actually use this you tell me and while he's getting comfortable we're going to continue the tour we don't need them what is this for like in the middle of a meeting is someone just going to be like sorry guys hey we're doing a tour i don't mind wait it's too comfortable no no it doesn't what i can't get in were you struggling to get inside that room all you gotta do is just that it picks up the bluetooth on my phone and it recognizes it's me so i can unlock the door so yeah this is my little apartment this is where i live for the most part so you actually sleep in your office of course this is my bed looks like my girlfriend left me a message yes if you want to sleep in my bed i won't stop you okay this is nice okay so in jimmy's fridge yogurt and water what we're potentially launching our own sauce at cheeseburger blur what's on it so they don't get the ingredients the only thing you have to eat them with is yogurt the worst part of my tiny apartment is uh the fridge blocks the tv i'm running out of room i missed that this is an enormous screen but it's above the couch so i don't use it these are all my clothes over here bathroom talk oh really even my bathroom's not off limits bro really we're about to just film the bathroom together so this is a heated toilet seat i'm telling you it will change your life get a heated toilet seat it will make your butt feel great josh yeah he's getting b-roll with my toilet this is kind of my morning routine i get out of bed i walk over here work out and i walk over here i shower and i walk over here i change and i walk over here and i eat it's like a little morning circuit and then i walk out there and i work and right over here is one of the cool rooms we also have a gaming channel and a react channel which we film in here iphone or android on three hold up what phone you use okay it's three well you have two why they're both iphones let's go nevermind good anyways we're actually here to show them the react set so come on in over here so this is where we film all our reacts videos let's react to some tech content let's see it you got to see the best tech video of all time is this like 360 camera wait josh what's going on here we go to video two no it just looks like it was rendered weird was this supposed to happen what is going on is that your cat's bum that's milo nice to meet you milo's butthole oh i know this video this is one of my favorite visions of the future these calendars here oh my gosh you can walk up to it like that so it knows what part of the room you are i love this idea this digital overlay on the real world i do too honestly i'm kind of pissed off we don't already have this could you see yourself using like all this kind of stuff 100 i mean i don't know how to ride a bike so not this i'm just thinking about like pokemon go too oh all right now we're on to our next clip with tesla there's no elon i'm disliking this is some very brave piloting yeah oh my gosh isn't it a tesla the safest car ever made in history remember it survived a crash test and actually broke the crash test dummy do you see teslas as like an art form i just like obviously that they don't run on fossil fuels faster than other cars it has more like amenities but i don't really use any of that the biggest pull to me for tesla is the interior like you sit down you feel like you're being of course if you're a car guy i'm just not who's this guy oh this i need yeah that looks very cool you like sushi right i do no screw this frick roll i don't care that was actually genius i'm calling someone to order them i know you were trying to prank us but i don't care wait i'm buying them hey i need some uh auto stick chopsticks love you you don't probably get much experience with android vents never this is the xiaomi 12s ultra one of its big selling points is the fact that it has the biggest camera sensor and a phone wow this is cool yeah this is crazy love it yeah the coloring's good look at that tell me that doesn't look like a wallpaper i can't say it's better but i can tell you it's how it works it's an interesting take because normally iphone users just kind of shut down android phones and for coming out to beast react studio you get a giant lot of money here you go thanks for coming out all right let's continue the tour android or iphone yes two more android points i hate you guys and this room over here i think you guys will enjoy so it's top secret but i'll let you in right in the back corner of the building of all the rooms in the building i feel like you would appreciate this the most all right so this is the mrb server room the way these guys have set it up is that all the projects that they're ever working on are stored right here on site in this server which means that every single computer in this entire complex is accessing the same set of files at the same time but the cherry on top is that it's configured so that even if you're sitting on the other side of the world you can actually remotely log in and access the editing machines here to use them to edit footage that's stored right here in this server so how much storage would you say you have in this room infinite what do you think the total cost of this room is 400 grand do you use android or iphone you play chess i do play chess on a game of chess now over the few days that i spent with jimmy the one key thing that i've learned about this guy is he takes board games seriously he absolutely came to me in a game of katan the night before chess was my way of making sure i won one back oh my god that was a girl game all right so this is the editing room and i had two things that i wanted to find out here one how fast is mr beast internet oh i see you know what i mean yeah what what upload this you know with footage finding stuff and two if these guys have any special gear to edit with yeah they kind of do the editors who prefer windows they'll be choosing 19 000 hp workstations with 24 core server grade processors and 256 gigabytes of ram and for those who prefer mac a pretty equivalent expect one thousand dollar mac pro wait that's how much they cost yeah feels like we've been in a lot of rooms but this is only part of it there's so many rooms in this building and it's so massive that's what i love about it i feel like i'm getting my steps in and over here is the little kitchen there's festival bars over here you should be eating this it's a very colorful selection of beverages you've never seen unicorn magic honeydew soda it was in there because it was a punishment for a video we don't obviously drink this it's actually really nice yeah so much sugar that i'm literally tearing up so i have an editing question for you actually you've got the most ridiculous camera gear available to you you've got 300 cameras in some videos you just upgraded your cameras actually to new ones that can shoot 8k resolution which i never will because i think it looks too professional yeah so this is the question why is it that after all that you still export in 1080p i don't like the way high quality footage looks you know at the end of the day it's just me and the boys messing around you know we still come up with the videos it's still things that i find fun and i enjoy and i don't ever want things to feel too produced why do you do 8k we do 4k to some extent in the tech genre there's like an expectation that you have good production value of course if i can't take good footage who am i to judge other phones for how good they listen 4k this is in 4k okay but there's a twist here you've come here thinking that jimmy has just one studio he actually has two we've just seen what they call studio c okay and this is studio a this is where it all began this is also where i've heard a lot of mystery secrets are and this is walt hi i'm walt i'm the head of on-site production for mr b's gaming and mr beast reacts there's a whole bunch of lights here yep what lights does mr beast use for his videos they're called sky panels every single one is a seven thousand dollar fixture i'm capable of lighting an entire warehouse on its own honestly that's like at least 10 12 kilos probably [Laughter] now because studio c is becoming the main office that everyone works out of studio a is the one where you find the most exotic items i'm talking like a mini drivable lamborghini giant fake marshmallows from when they tried to recreate willy wonka's chocolate factory and then tubs upon tubs of costumes that they used in their recreation of the squid games so this is the gaming trailer oh yeah iphone or android i am iphone i got a 12 pro max this cabin which is a part of studio a is where the entirety of the mr beast gaming channel is filmed and it's kind of nerd paradise the shelves upon shelves of wonderful and questionable tech items there's a real ice cream machine and there's nerf guns everywhere but then we go deeper inside so this is the office where i kind of currently work out of is this what i think it is yeah it was the retro future the custom made original game boy wow the logo the sesame seeds the pink power button you can change the color on the screen it has that authentic that is wild you can't beat it weirdly that's one of the coolest pieces of tech i've seen so far here we have jimmy's gaming room the main idea with these setups is that they could sit down and then be good to go filming within a minute or two i'm gonna sit down and i'm gonna rate mr b's gaming setup oh good choice of chair you can tell that the entire setup here is just geared around efficiency they've got it to the point that with one tap of this button here all lights can be turned on and off and with the top of this button all the relevant programs that they need to film one of these gaming videos they are loaded and ready in one go including the software to be able to see your own camera view in real time the mouse is really smooth this is the most responsive windows experience i've ever had the keyboard is a membrane keyboard which is normally considered like a tier below but you've done that for noise really yeah intentionally and so given that it's actually actually really nice to type on it doesn't feel bad the keys have nice travel he's done a definite solid with this controller this is my favorite looking xbox controller ever the chrome outlines around each button are nice this is a very good choice of mic and if you're wondering what the pc is that mr beast uses for gaming with an i9 11 900k 32 gigs of ram and an rtx 3090 graphics card hooked up to a 4k 120hz monitor this whole setup would be around 15 000 but that's not the crazy part because there isn't just one of them the entire room has actually been almost 100 cloned four times one for each of the characters in jimmy's videos chandler carl and chris they all have slightly different chairs and keyboards based on their preferences but the core machines behind it are one-to-one so this is the storage worker this is the storage of our house i've been told this is the weirdest place yes you need giant 40-inch touchscreen iphones got those yeah so as you can tell i'm very heavily on to team iphone so this giant iphone it's essentially a real iphone 6s that's casting its screen to an apple tv box screwed into the back that's hooked up to a large tv screen it sounds ridiculous but it works this is wild this is like the one part of it that i i wouldn't have thought actually works yeah i could take a portrait mode all right let's do that yeah i got it i got you i got you there we go there you go left my mark this storage center is just rammed with all the stuff that's been used in past videos that might need to be used in future videos literally anything you can think of tiki torches rubber chickens an even bigger nano leaf light collection then we have even a box full of shockingly realistic babies don't ask me why it's here pretty much all the expensive stuff lies within here as far as like phones to give away it's always apple i think you're just broken i'll scare you a little bit i'm sorry and to wrap up the studio tour i wanted to show him something cool so walk with me boys oh there's a plant there we're doing a video where i put a guy inside of this red circle see that outline around the house and if he survives in there for 100 days straight he wins half a million dollars okay so we've seen studio c we've seen studio a we've seen whatever this is we've got the full price of all the tech inside what is the actual cost of the buildings themselves oh boy the big studio over there was a little over 10 million dollars the old one actually was a church that we renovated that was like probably 1.3 million so okay 11.3 million dollars in buildings yeah everything i don't even want to know the total you know what i just make the best videos possible and sometimes i have to spend money and if you enjoyed this video then a sub to the channel would be he told me to say beastly you might have noticed over the last few months that the entire way that i'm trying to make my videos is changing the way i spend much more time moving between locations and being out and about the way i'm trying to get more interactions with youtube friends and members of the public and how i'm trying to have a clear golden moment in every video a culmination of everything that rewards you the viewer for clicking a lot of this stuff has come from the storytelling through film course that i found on skillshare by a guy called thomas de gea and the thing that really struck me about this is how efficiently you can learn stuff on this platform there's no clickbait there's no ads and it's organized in such a way that you can pick up any new skill in practically any category from animation to marketing start to

"transcript": " 5 years ago, when I couldn\u2019t get\u00a0\na job after graduating college,\u00a0\u00a0 I decided to learn coding. 2 years after\u00a0\nwriting my first hello world program,\u00a0\u00a0 I got into Amazon and last year, I joined Google\u00a0\nas a Software Engineer. Even though I made a good\u00a0\u00a0 progress in the last 5 years and I am grateful\u00a0\nto be where I am today, there\u2019s a part of me\u00a0\u00a0 that still wonders if I could have done better.\u00a0\nYou see, I spent countless hours watching youtube\u00a0\u00a0 videos trying to figure out the best method to learn\u00a0\nprogramming in a way that not only gets me a job,\u00a0\u00a0 but also sets me up for a great career as a\u00a0\nSoftware Engineer. I could not find a single\u00a0\u00a0 comprehensive video that explained how to\u00a0\nlearn coding from scratch step by step. So,\u00a0\u00a0 I had to try out many different things that people\u00a0\nwere recommending on Youtube. As a result, I\u00a0\u00a0 started learning Python, Java, Javascript, React,\u00a0\nRedux all at once. After learning all this, when I\u00a0\u00a0 looked behind to check where I had reached, I was\u00a0\nin the exact same spot where I started: I was Jobless.\u00a0\u00a0 It took me many many months to climb out of that\u00a0\ndarkness. If only there was a video which gave me\u00a0\u00a0 all the steps I need to take to learn programming\u00a0\nin a practical way, I would not only be in the\u00a0\u00a0 exact same place as today in much less time,\u00a0\nI might have also become a better programmer.\u00a0\u00a0 What you\u2019re watching right now is the video I\u00a0\nwish I had when I started learning programming. Before I get into the 4 step process and give\u00a0\nyou all the free resources I would use to learn\u00a0\u00a0 programming, let\u2019s discuss what I would pick\u00a0\nfor my programming language. I want to talk about\u00a0\u00a0 3 popular options here. First and one of the most\u00a0\npopular options is Javascript. Though Javascript\u00a0\u00a0 is used in the backend with the help of Node,\u00a0\nmost of its demand still comes from the\u00a0\u00a0 front end. So, I am going to assume that if I were\u00a0\nto pick Javascript as my first language, I want to\u00a0\u00a0 do front end development. If you don\u2019t already\u00a0\nknow, HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the basic\u00a0\u00a0 building blocks of front end development. But,\u00a0\nthese 3 are not enough to become an employable\u00a0\u00a0 Software Engineer. You need to learn some more\u00a0\nlibraries or frameworks on top of these to be on\u00a0\u00a0 par with the industry. Some example frameworks for\u00a0\nCSS that I learnt are Bootstrap and Tailwind but\u00a0\u00a0 there are many other options. For Javascript, you\u00a0\nwill need to learn React, Angular or Vue to land a\u00a0\u00a0 job. There are some other advanced technologies\u00a0\nlike Redux and NextJS that might be needed in\u00a0\u00a0 some cases. As you might have already guessed,\u00a0\nthis path is long and hard for beginners. That\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 why I would not pick Javascript if I was just\u00a0\nstarting out. Next popular option is learning\u00a0\u00a0 Python which most people recommend. Python has\u00a0\nmany applications in backend, automation and\u00a0\u00a0 data science. Why most people recommend Python\u00a0\nis because it\u2019s one of the easiest language to learn.\u00a0\u00a0 Syntax of python is very simple and easy to pick.\u00a0\nPython will also give you an advantage in coding\u00a0\u00a0 interviews because it requires less lines of\u00a0\ncode for the same amount of code. Due to all these\u00a0\u00a0 advantages, I had recommended Python in my video\u00a0\non Fastest way to learn coding and get a job. But,\u00a0\u00a0 this video is not about taking shortcuts.\nWhat we need to understand is that all this\u00a0\u00a0 ease of learning comes at the cost of\u00a0\nperformance. I don\u2019t want to get into\u00a0\u00a0 too many details here but Python is slower than\u00a0\nother programming languages like Java or C++.\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s because it\u2019s dynamically typed and it\u2019s an\u00a0\ninterpreted language. If you don't know what that\u00a0\u00a0 is, that\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it. Just know\u00a0\nthat Python is slower. Another issue with Python\u00a0\u00a0 is that it has limited support for concurrency.\u00a0\nFor these reasons, Python is rarely used to\u00a0\u00a0 build complex backend systems. If I look at my own\u00a0\nexperience, most of Amazon's backend is written in\u00a0\u00a0 Java and most of Google\u2019s is in C++. And I have so\u00a0\nmany friends who work on the backends of companies\u00a0\u00a0 like Microsoft, Uber and Facebook and they don\u2019t\u00a0\nuse Python in their services at all. Since my goal\u00a0\u00a0 from day 1 was to become a good Software Engineer\u00a0\nalong with getting a job, I would actually pick\u00a0\u00a0 the third option which is Java. Along with\u00a0the performance benefits I just mentioned,\u00a0\u00a0 Java has some other advantages for beginners.\u00a0\nJava is a mature language and there\u2019re a ton of\u00a0\u00a0 resources to learn Java. Because it\u2019s a compiled\u00a0\nlanguage, errors in Java can be caught at the compile time\u00a0\u00a0 and are very descriptive. Since Java has been\u00a0\naround for so long, you can find solutions to\u00a0\u00a0 most errors on Stack Overflow which makes it very\u00a0\neasy to debug. And did I mention the amazing\u00a0\u00a0 documentation Oracle provides for Java. We\u2019ll see\u00a0\nhow to use this documentation in a moment when I cover\u00a0\u00a0 how I would learn Java. But, I have\u00a0\nstill not told you the best part about learning\u00a0\u00a0 Java. And that is: Once you\u2019ve learnt Java, you\u00a0\ncan pick up any other language very easily. For me,\u00a0\u00a0 I started with learning Java. When I felt I needed\u00a0\nPython to speed up my interview performance,\u00a0\u00a0 I picked it up in a couple of weeks. When\u00a0\nI wanted to learn web development using\u00a0\u00a0 Javascript based React, that didn\u2019t take me a\u00a0\nlong time either. And as I switched jobs,\u00a0\u00a0 I had to program in C++, Golang and some\u00a0\nother languages and I never had any problems. Now that we have that out of the way, let\u2019s talk about Step 1, which is: Learn Java. If you have watched any\u00a0\u00a0 of my previous videos before, you know that I\u00a0\nam a strong believer in learning by doing. So,\u00a0\u00a0 instead of falling asleep while\u00a0\nwatching a long Java tutorial,\u00a0\u00a0 I would actually get to work and start coding.\u00a0\nLet me show you some resources that I would use.\u00a0\u00a0 The best free resource to learn Java interactively\u00a0\nis this aptly named course called \u201cLearn Java\u201d on\u00a0\u00a0 Codeacademy. On top of covering basic concepts\u00a0\nlike variables, if else statements and loops,\u00a0\u00a0 this course also teaches slightly advanced\u00a0\nconcepts like Object Oriented Programming,\u00a0\u00a0 Encapsulation and Inheritance. I would pay special\u00a0\nattention to these advanced concepts because these\u00a0\u00a0 are the fundamentals of Software Development. Each\u00a0\nchapter comes with a free \u201cLesson\u201d portion and\u00a0\u00a0 paid \u201cQuiz\u201d and \u201cProject\u201d. I would focus on the\u00a0free\nlesson part for now. Each lesson introduces you to\u00a0\u00a0 a new concept, and guides you through an exercise\u00a0\nat the end. It also provides you a way to write\u00a0\u00a0 and run all the code within the browser. If you\u2019re\u00a0\nstuck, you can also get a hint. Here are 2 things\u00a0\u00a0 I would not do while using Codecademy. Number one,\u00a0\nI would not copy paste the code. When you write\u00a0\u00a0 the code yourself, you get used to the syntax.\u00a0\nNumber two, I would not use the hint before trying\u00a0\u00a0 to solve the problem myself. Another advantage of\u00a0\nlearning programming this way is that if I make\u00a0\u00a0 a mistake, I\u2019ll have to debug the error myself. I can\u00a0\nalways google the error and look for the solution\u00a0\u00a0 on websites like Stack Overflow. \nI can also try to debug the error using the Java\u00a0\u00a0 documentation. For example, in this error, I can\u00a0\nsee that the printline function doesn\u2019t exist. So,\u00a0\u00a0 I can go to the documentation and figure out what\u00a0\nfunctions are actually available to me. If I could\u00a0\u00a0 spend some money, I would do this course called \u201cLearn\u00a0\nJava from scratch\u201d on Educative. This course is\u00a0\u00a0 very comprehensive and also gives you challenges\u00a0\nand quizzes at the end of every chapter. Now that I have learnt Java, I\u2019ll move\u00a0\nonto the next step, which is Step number 2:\u00a0\u00a0 Build Guided Projects. In this step, I will follow\u00a0\nalong with instructors as they build some cool\u00a0\u00a0 projects in Java. There are many options that I\u00a0\ncan choose from but here are a few examples. For\u00a0\u00a0 my first project, I would follow this tutorial\u00a0\nfrom freecodecamp where the instructor builds\u00a0\u00a0 Sudoku from scratch. There are many things that I\u00a0\nwon\u2019t understand in this tutorial at first but I\u00a0\u00a0 would google everything and use Java documentation\u00a0\nto understand as much as I can. Once I am done\u00a0\u00a0 with the first project, I would move onto a\u00a0\nslightly advanced project. For my second project,\u00a0\u00a0 I would build a snake game that I used to play\u00a0\non my dad\u2019s Nokia 3315 back in the day. For that,\u00a0\u00a0 I would follow this fun tutorial from \u201cbro\u00a0\ncode\u201d. Even though bro explains everything very\u00a0\u00a0 well but if I still don\u2019t understand something,\u00a0\nI know that Java documentation is my friend. After following these tutorials, let\u2019s move onto\u00a0\nstep 3, which is, Build your own projects. To do\u00a0 that, I would start with a small idea and keep\u00a0\nexpanding on it to build a bigger and better\u00a0\u00a0 project. Let me give you an example to show\u00a0\nyou what I mean by that. In the first 2 steps,\u00a0\u00a0 I would have already learnt the basics of Java.\u00a0\nBut, the elusive concepts like Polymorphism and\u00a0\u00a0 Inheritance are very easy to forget. So, I\u00a0\nwould build a program that helps me remember\u00a0\u00a0 the concepts that I have already learnt. This\u00a0\nprogram gives me a random question to answer from\u00a0\u00a0 a pre-stored list of questions. To make it more\u00a0\ninteresting, I can make these questions multiple\u00a0\u00a0 choice and give the program ability to tell if\u00a0\nI chose the right option. I can also make this\u00a0\u00a0 program send a question every day to my inbox to\u00a0\nkeep me on track with my learning. If I am looking\u00a0\u00a0 for some more adventure, I can move this program\u00a0\nto a server rather than using my own computer.\u00a0\u00a0 I will call this program from my computer and\u00a0\nit will send back the question and the answer\u00a0\u00a0 options to me. By the way, this program would now be called\u00a0\nan API. Instead of storing these questions in\u00a0\u00a0 an array or something similar, I would store them\u00a0\nin a database on the server. If I want to take it\u00a0\u00a0 to the next level, I can use the Java that I have\u00a0\nalready learnt to make an Android app that calls\u00a0\u00a0 my API, shows the question and lets me select\u00a0my answer on the app. There's no end to it, I hope you got the point. After building my own projects,\u00a0\nI would move onto the step 4,\u00a0\u00a0 which is, Learning Data Structures and Algorithms.\u00a0\nWhen I was learning Java and building projects,\u00a0\u00a0 I would have come across many data structures\u00a0\nlike Array, ArrayLists and Maps etc. As a\u00a0\u00a0 Software Engineer, it\u2019s very important to know\u00a0\nwhen exactly to use these data structures. You\u00a0\u00a0 also need to know some algorithms that can help\u00a0\nyou do certain tasks efficiently. For example,\u00a0\u00a0 if you wanted to find the shortest path\u00a0\nbetween point a and point b on the map,\u00a0\u00a0 like Google maps does, how would you do it? To\u00a0\nlearn Data Structures and Algorithms, I would\u00a0\u00a0 go to Coursera and look up this course called\u00a0\nAlgorithms by Princeton University. This course\u00a0\u00a0 is taught in Java and comes in 2 parts. First part\u00a0\ncovers data structures like stacks, queues and\u00a0\u00a0 algorithms like MergeSort and Union Find. Second\u00a0\npart covers advanced concepts like graphs, tries,\u00a0\u00a0 shortest path etc. I would implement some of\u00a0\nthese data structures and algorithms by myself\u00a0\u00a0 to further solidify my knowledge and improve\u00a0\nmy Java skills. This course also forms the basis of\u00a0\u00a0 most tech interviews that I will have to go through to get a job.\u00a0\nSo, I would pay special attention to this course.\u00a0\u00a0 I would also use resources like Geeksforgeeks\u00a0\nand Leetcode to improve my interviewing skills. If you think that this entire path\u00a0\nis too long and you are looking for\u00a0\u00a0 a shortcut to learn programming and get\u00a0\na job, you can watch this video at the\u00a0\u00a0 top. I will see you in the next one.", "timestamp": "2024-06-20 01:19:24"}, {"video_id": "PWirijQkH4M&t", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWirijQkH4M&t=5s", "summary": "## The Ultimate Obstacle Course Challenge\n\n### Level 1\n- Objective: Jump swinging hammers to reach the other platform\n- Contestant: Mack\n\n### Level 2\n- Objective: Choose between balance beam or monkey bars to cross a platform\n- Contestant: Mack\n- Penalty for failure: Free fall into a net, losing 800 grand\n\n### Level 3\n- Objective: Memorize and cross a 44-tile pattern on a floor\n- Contestant: Mack\n- Penalty for stepping on a red tile: Exploding the money\n\n### Level 4\n- Objective: Navigate through a series of obstacles without falling into the water\n- Tools available: Feastables chocolate bar to prevent falling\n- Contestant: Mack\n\n### Level 5\n- Objective: Cross three rolling logs and retrieve money bags\n- Challenge: Logs located 200 feet in the air\n- Contestant: Mack\n- Option: Return for more bags or move on with the money obtained\n\n### Level 6\n- Objective: Complete a series of obstacles, including:\n    - Trapeze bars\n    - Giant swinging hammers\n    - Balance beam\n    - Umbrella cookies\n- Contestant: Mack\n- Reward for completion: $800,000\n\n### Result\n- Mack successfully completes all six levels and wins $800,000, which he plans to share with childhood friends in need.", "transcript": " I have built the most\ndeadly obstacle course in the world, and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it\nwithout falling 200 feet to the ground. Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000.

no pillars\n* Soundproofed ceiling and sprinklers\n* Ten thousand dollars in briefcases (empty)\n* Multiple flo", "transcript": " this is mr beast and he has just invited me to his top secret youtube warehouse well actually we're currently inside of it and i want to show you guys around so he can get views we're going to show you where his videos are filmed how his videos are edited and then finally how much a ridiculous setup like this actually costs and i'm a little scared because i've never shown anyone around this studio this is gonna be a first time this is gonna be cool come in here is around 50 000 square feet there's no polls or anything so we can just build sets we can do whatever we want you know what's blowing my mind this is not what i associate with youtube you know what's funny that's literally what everyone says when they come in here they're like for youtube one thing i noticed immediately when i walked in is like you clap you hear nothing back yeah except these guys in the back yeah they're working on a video that's exactly right so we soundproof the ceiling on top of that uh you'll probably notice there's hundreds of sprinklers on the ceiling do you have sprinklers because you keep blowing stuff up in here yeah exactly no you could blow up a car there and not have to worry about burning them in the building that's a rare use case scenario in one of our coming up video we need a million dollars these are empty don't try to rob me right now so we're putting ten thousand dollars in a hundred briefcases is there a reason you've settled on this particular model of briefcase does this just not look like ten thousand dollars i don't know it could be maybe more golden [Laughter] okay time to ask jimmy the big question android or iphone obviously iphone steve jobs steve jobs name the person who created android andy rubin okay well i didn't know that we'll keep a tally of every single person we meet in this tour this right here is one of our coming up videos the beauty of having all this space is our old warehouse was basically the size of this room this room feels like there was some havoc yeah there's a lot of havoc there's just like random broken bits of tech and eggs yeah so you should remember that if you show anything bad i'm gonna get egged that was a threat oh you're gonna break tech in front of me yeah yeah i will this was our little hub over here that you would have thought was baller so this is what it looked like when we were filming so you could see all the girls cameras there all the boys cameras there so we could constantly monitor it this is the kind of stuff we don't normally show we had to have six or seven people here monitoring every angle because if they just touch the red line they're out you have to basically set up like 40 cameras so you can monitor every single inch of the line what they're doing on top of content and there's two of them it's a role you don't think about yeah what did you do today i stared at girls for a hundred hours like you might want to refreeze i stared at a red line for a hundred dollars someone's getting a little edgy over here yeah and on top of that you can zoom in as well so we have tons of shots but just zooming into their mouths or whatever they're eating food oh my god like what kind of zoom level do you want to go to the camera room yeah okay james he's curious do you use iphone or android oh two to zero two zeros steve jobs wrapped around the studio is tons of office space multiple floors you'll just see like these are some people planning our next video is that room called boobs i didn't do it all right so this is the camera room yes some videos we use 100 cameras some videos we use 10 some we need to be able to zoom in 100x something we need a hundred vlog cameras for hide and seek there's a lot of weird things in here you want to summon tariq by some of them you're summoning them hey what's up this transition is going to suck this is tariq he's had a camera hello he's going to show us what's going on here i've never seen so much camera gear in my entire life we have 26 fs5s these are the time-lapse cameras that you guys see so every time you see a time-lapse shot this camera is usually hanging somewhere on set capturing it okay what just to give you guys an idea the fs5 was a six thousand dollar camera when it was launched in 2015. these guys have 26 of them five kids 26. let's do the math yeah the total is a lot and then you've got loads of the same lens so the way it works is every single camera lens has a focal length which basically just indicates how zoomed in it is our videos relative to these are very homegrown we film most of them in my bedroom the widest angle we have is like 24 mil and the most telescopic one we have is like a 55mm but these guys when they go wide they go wide this is a 10 millimeter lens which is used to capture the entirety of a massive video set in one shot and then when they want to get close-ups from further away they have a lens here capable of not 50 millimeters or 80 millimeters but 300 millimeters this is a telescope but there's three more key cameras that the mysteries team uses the first being the sony 4k camcorder so we usually use these for run and gun videos slash when we have a lot of night time shots and that's because it has not just actual night vision but also just insane optical image stabilization look how much the lens moves on the inside and then to top it all off there's about 50 gopro cameras in these boxes here and another 50 of what are effectively super high-end security cameras each capable of streaming a live view of their feed so that people in that control center can keep an eye on the video contestants in real time oh and also they have 20 times optical zoom and then the pista resistance this is an fvv drone that looks like you've made it we have an fpv pilot you build this you built it yeah it's actually wild that's something that someone has built themselves is a big part of your filming gear i'm putting you on the spot here all right can you guess the total value of tech in this room i'm about to be so wrong 1.3 million sweet it's been great thank you so much man oh and thank god i'm back tariq sucks i won't leave again i kind of missed you jimmy oh my gosh we're missing a lot of our play buttons we do our videos in tons of languages this is just our english channels this is mr b6 000 so what point did you change it in between 100k and a million apparently but anyways this is missing a lot don't look at it it's ugly do you have iphone or android i don't know which one i have android are you using oh wait so that's one for android one for android you use iphone well i guess a point for both it's 2022 and if you're still buying white boards you are an idiot there's a thing called whiteboard paint you can just draw wherever it doesn't matter it comes off so for us any note that we make we make it a thing to keep it digital you want to keep it online so that anyone can kind of log in and check it do you guys not care about that no no we're wall drawers i grab a water no he took it anyways this is an enormous screen when we got this place someone was like yeah we got free tvs and that was all i was told i don't even shout out to sony get your marketing budget on this it turns out jimmy's free tvs that you find all around this building they're actually sony's new 85-inch 8k hdr smart tvs and they're being used to watch 1080p content fantastic very comfortable that's an ipad holder yeah but does anyone actually use this you tell me and while he's getting comfortable we're going to continue the tour we don't need them what is this for like in the middle of a meeting is someone just going to be like sorry guys hey we're doing a tour i don't mind wait it's too comfortable no no it doesn't what i can't get in were you struggling to get inside that room all you gotta do is just that it picks up the bluetooth on my phone and it recognizes it's me so i can unlock the door so yeah this is my little apartment this is where i live for the most part so you actually sleep in your office of course this is my bed looks like my girlfriend left me a message yes if you want to sleep in my bed i won't stop you okay this is nice okay so in jimmy's fridge yogurt and water what we're potentially launching our own sauce at cheeseburger blur what's on it so they don't get the ingredients the only thing you have to eat them with is yogurt the worst part of my tiny apartment is uh the fridge blocks the tv i'm running out of room i missed that this is an enormous screen but it's above the couch so i don't use it these are all my clothes over here bathroom talk oh really even my bathroom's not off limits bro really we're about to just film the bathroom together so this is a heated toilet seat i'm telling you it will change your life get a heated toilet seat it will make your butt feel great josh yeah he's getting b-roll with my toilet this is kind of my morning routine i get out of bed i walk over here work out and i walk over here i shower and i walk over here i change and i walk over here and i eat it's like a little morning circuit and then i walk out there and i work and right over here is one of the cool rooms we also have a gaming channel and a react channel which we film in here iphone or android on three hold up what phone you use okay it's three well you have two why they're both iphones let's go nevermind good anyways we're actually here to show them the react set so come on in over here so this is where we film all our reacts videos let's react to some tech content let's see it you got to see the best tech video of all time is this like 360 camera wait josh what's going on here we go to video two no it just looks like it was rendered weird was this supposed to happen what is going on is that your cat's bum that's milo nice to meet you milo's butthole oh i know this video this is one of my favorite visions of the future these calendars here oh my gosh you can walk up to it like that so it knows what part of the room you are i love this idea this digital overlay on the real world i do too honestly i'm kind of pissed off we don't already have this could you see yourself using like all this kind of stuff 100 i mean i don't know how to ride a bike so not this i'm just thinking about like pokemon go too oh all right now we're on to our next clip with tesla there's no elon i'm disliking this is some very brave piloting yeah oh my gosh isn't it a tesla the safest car ever made in history remember it survived a crash test and actually broke the crash test dummy do you see teslas as like an art form i just like obviously that they don't run on fossil fuels faster than other cars it has more like amenities but i don't really use any of that the biggest pull to me for tesla is the interior like you sit down you feel like you're being of course if you're a car guy i'm just not who's this guy oh this i need yeah that looks very cool you like sushi right i do no screw this frick roll i don't care that was actually genius i'm calling someone to order them i know you were trying to prank us but i don't care wait i'm buying them hey i need some uh auto stick chopsticks love you you don't probably get much experience with android vents never this is the xiaomi 12s ultra one of its big selling points is the fact that it has the biggest camera sensor and a phone wow this is cool yeah this is crazy love it yeah the coloring's good look at that tell me that doesn't look like a wallpaper i can't say it's better but i can tell you it's how it works it's an interesting take because normally iphone users just kind of shut down android phones and for coming out to beast react studio you get a giant lot of money here you go thanks for coming out all right let's continue the tour android or iphone yes two more android points i hate you guys and this room over here i think you guys will enjoy so it's top secret but i'll let you in right in the back corner of the building of all the rooms in the building i feel like you would appreciate this the most all right so this is the mrb server room the way these guys have set it up is that all the projects that they're ever working on are stored right here on site in this server which means that every single computer in this entire complex is accessing the same set of files at the same time but the cherry on top is that it's configured so that even if you're sitting on the other side of the world you can actually remotely log in and access the editing machines here to use them to edit footage that's stored right here in this server so how much storage would you say you have in this room infinite what do you think the total cost of this room is 400 grand do you use android or iphone you play chess i do play chess on a game of chess now over the few days that i spent with jimmy the one key thing that i've learned about this guy is he takes board games seriously he absolutely came to me in a game of katan the night before chess was my way of making sure i won one back oh my god that was a girl game all right so this is the editing room and i had two things that i wanted to find out here one how fast is mr beast internet oh i see you know what i mean yeah what what upload this you know with footage finding stuff and two if these guys have any special gear to edit with yeah they kind of do the editors who prefer windows they'll be choosing 19 000 hp workstations with 24 core server grade processors and 256 gigabytes of ram and for those who prefer mac a pretty equivalent expect one thousand dollar mac pro wait that's how much they cost yeah feels like we've been in a lot of rooms but this is only part of it there's so many rooms in this building and it's so massive that's what i love about it i feel like i'm getting my steps in and over here is the little kitchen there's festival bars over here you should be eating this it's a very colorful selection of beverages you've never seen unicorn magic honeydew soda it was in there because it was a punishment for a video we don't obviously drink this it's actually really nice yeah so much sugar that i'm literally tearing up so i have an editing question for you actually you've got the most ridiculous camera gear available to you you've got 300 cameras in some videos you just upgraded your cameras actually to new ones that can shoot 8k resolution which i never will because i think it looks too professional yeah so this is the question why is it that after all that you still export in 1080p i don't like the way high quality footage looks you know at the end of the day it's just me and the boys messing around you know we still come up with the videos it's still things that i find fun and i enjoy and i don't ever want things to feel too produced why do you do 8k we do 4k to some extent in the tech genre there's like an expectation that you have good production value of course if i can't take good footage who am i to judge other phones for how good they listen 4k this is in 4k okay but there's a twist here you've come here thinking that jimmy has just one studio he actually has two we've just seen what they call studio c okay and this is studio a this is where it all began this is also where i've heard a lot of mystery secrets are and this is walt hi i'm walt i'm the head of on-site production for mr b's gaming and mr beast reacts there's a whole bunch of lights here yep what lights does mr beast use for his videos they're called sky panels every single one is a seven thousand dollar fixture i'm capable of lighting an entire warehouse on its own honestly that's like at least 10 12 kilos probably [Laughter] now because studio c is becoming the main office that everyone works out of studio a is the one where you find the most exotic items i'm talking like a mini drivable lamborghini giant fake marshmallows from when they tried to recreate willy wonka's chocolate factory and then tubs upon tubs of costumes that they used in their recreation of the squid games so this is the gaming trailer oh yeah iphone or android i am iphone i got a 12 pro max this cabin which is a part of studio a is where the entirety of the mr beast gaming channel is filmed and it's kind of nerd paradise the shelves upon shelves of wonderful and questionable tech items there's a real ice cream machine and there's nerf guns everywhere but then we go deeper inside so this is the office where i kind of currently work out of is this what i think it is yeah it was the retro future the custom made original game boy wow the logo the sesame seeds the pink power button you can change the color on the screen it has that authentic that is wild you can't beat it weirdly that's one of the coolest pieces of tech i've seen so far here we have jimmy's gaming room the main idea with these setups is that they could sit down and then be good to go filming within a minute or two i'm gonna sit down and i'm gonna rate mr b's gaming setup oh good choice of chair you can tell that the entire setup here is just geared around efficiency they've got it to the point that with one tap of this button here all lights can be turned on and off and with the top of this button all the relevant programs that they need to film one of these gaming videos they are loaded and ready in one go including the software to be able to see your own camera view in real time the mouse is really smooth this is the most responsive windows experience i've ever had the keyboard is a membrane keyboard which is normally considered like a tier below but you've done that for noise really yeah intentionally and so given that it's actually actually really nice to type on it doesn't feel bad the keys have nice travel he's done a definite solid with this controller this is my favorite looking xbox controller ever the chrome outlines around each button are nice this is a very good choice of mic and if you're wondering what the pc is that mr beast uses for gaming with an i9 11 900k 32 gigs of ram and an rtx 3090 graphics card hooked up to a 4k 120hz monitor this whole setup would be around 15 000 but that's not the crazy part because there isn't just one of them the entire room has actually been almost 100 cloned four times one for each of the characters in jimmy's videos chandler carl and chris they all have slightly different chairs and keyboards based on their preferences but the core machines behind it are one-to-one so this is the storage worker this is the storage of our house i've been told this is the weirdest place yes you need giant 40-inch touchscreen iphones got those yeah so as you can tell i'm very heavily on to team iphone so this giant iphone it's essentially a real iphone 6s that's casting its screen to an apple tv box screwed into the back that's hooked up to a large tv screen it sounds ridiculous but it works this is wild this is like the one part of it that i i wouldn't have thought actually works yeah i could take a portrait mode all right let's do that yeah i got it i got you i got you there we go there you go left my mark this storage center is just rammed with all the stuff that's been used in past videos that might need to be used in future videos literally anything you can think of tiki torches rubber chickens an even bigger nano leaf light collection then we have even a box full of shockingly realistic babies don't ask me why it's here pretty much all the expensive stuff lies within here as far as like phones to give away it's always apple i think you're just broken i'll scare you a little bit i'm sorry and to wrap up the studio tour i wanted to show him something cool so walk with me boys oh there's a plant there we're doing a video where i put a guy inside of this red circle see that outline around the house and if he survives in there for 100 days straight he wins half a million dollars okay so we've seen studio c we've seen studio a we've seen whatever this is we've got the full price of all the tech inside what is the actual cost of the buildings themselves oh boy the big studio over there was a little over 10 million dollars the old one actually was a church that we renovated that was like probably 1.3 million so okay 11.3 million dollars in buildings yeah everything i don't even want to know the total you know what i just make the best videos possible and sometimes i have to spend money and if you enjoyed this video then a sub to the channel would be he told me to say beastly you might have noticed over the last few months that the entire way that i'm trying to make my videos is changing the way i spend much more time moving between locations and being out and about the way i'm trying to get more interactions with youtube friends and members of the public and how i'm trying to have a clear golden moment in every video a culmination of everything that rewards you the viewer for clicking a lot of this stuff has come from the storytelling through film course that i found on skillshare by a guy called thomas de gea and the thing that really struck me about this is how efficiently you can learn stuff on this platform there's no clickbait there's no ads and it's organized in such a way that you can pick up any new skill in practically any category from animation to marketing start to finish in 30 minutes the first thousand of you to sign up using my code or

(contestants cheering) The first game we're gonna\nplay is red light, green light. They have 30 minutes to cross the red line on the other side of the huge room. So without further ado, green light. (tense music) Red light. (gun shot) Oh, oh. And as you can see, every single player has a\ndevice strapped to them, that when they're eliminated, it pops. Chris, you wanna have a chance at one? - Red light. (gun shot) Oh, oh, no. - I know for sure this guy moved. Green light. - Red light. Oh yo, they're dropping. Okay, now some people are getting out. - You gotta get a better spot for the next red light, right? - Mmhmm. - You're fine. - 30 people have gotten out so far. If they move right now, they're out. They have to hold this position\nuntil we say green light. And I can take all the time I want, 'cause we still have 23 minutes left. - We gotta get a green light going. This guy's doing a full squat. - Green light. Green light. Oh they all stopped. Red light. (gun shot)\nOh. - I called it, I called it. Oh no. - Can you push my glasses up? - Okay. - Do it slowly though, be careful. - Are you good? - Yeah, perfect.\n- Okay. Green light. Red light. You're still moving. She was jogging over here. We're gonna go see who's in the very back. You are in dead last. What's going on? - I let the others clear the path for me. - You literally haven't even moved. - Well, a couple steps. - We'll see if it pans out, green light. Yellow, red light. Oh, that we got her,\nthe yellow light worked. - Oh, that was diabolical to\nthrow a yellow light out there. - Since 067 was a big part of the show. I'll let you say green light. - [All] Green light. - Red light, yo, it would be\nfunny if she just got out. As you can see, over 100\npeople have been eliminated. Do the honors, Chandler. - Green light, red light. (gun shot) - [Mr. Beast] Oh, that was a loud one. - There it is, ay. - Green light. Red light. Look how close they\nare to the finish line. It is do or die for most of these people. Everyone look up at the TV. You have four minutes and 20 seconds left. - Yeah, that's the number. - Green light, red light. We have our first two finishers over here. - Lets go! - Green light, red light. - Yes sir, baby. Yes sir, baby. - [Mr. Beast] All right, we have five people across\nthe finish line now. - [Chandler] You're all kind of screwed if you don't run faster. - Yep, you're right. - Green light. Red light. - Only two minutes remain. - Karl makes me way too nervous. - Green light. Red light. - We have under one minute remaining. Time's ticking, green light. Red light. You have stepped on\nthe line, you are good. You're good. You're good. - Lets go! - Red light. (gun shot) It worked, it worked, we got em. You're definitely out. Dude, I knew that would work, green light. Red light. You're definitely, so\nmany of you just got out. - They gotta run faster. - They've gotta, you gotta sprint. - Green light. Green light. I'm not even gonna say red light, I'm not saying red light. Ah, its too late. Too late. (crowd cheering) - Whoa. - Holy crap. - Congratulations on surviving\nred light green light. (contestants cheering) So if you look at this TV, you'll see that only (TV twinkling) 232 of you survived. If you look above your head, you'll see the $456,000\nyou're competing for. And now let's move on to honeycomb. In honeycomb, everyone gets a needle, and a cookie with a different shape on it, and they have 10 minutes to remove the shape from the cookie. But if they break the\nshape, they're eliminated. All right, so everybody\nI'm gonna need you to get in the line in front of one of these question marks. (tense music) Why did you pick this one? - Just like, the middle. - Basically you don't think it's umbrella. - There's an umbrella? - Did you even watch Squid Game? - So many of these people\nare about to get out. - Reveal shape number one. (contestants cheering) - Reveal the second symbol. (contestants cheering) Look at how hype they're getting. If I was you, I'd be\ngetting pretty nervous. Reveal it! (contestants cheering) Chris, go for it. - No! - I know umbrella going home. That's all I got to say. - We got the circle. Thank God\nwe didn't get the umbrella. (tense music) - You look pretty nervous over here. Even though you got the star, you're the main character. so you have plot armor, you're fine. Start the timer. The challenge is underway. You just hear them all scraping. - I hate my life. - I was taking it out of the tin, and it just snapped in half. - Lets see it. - It's working. (clock ticking) - Take your time. - You had an umbrella? - Yeah.\n- Sorry bud. - Look at this. We have\na successful triangle. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Oh no. - What Jimmy doesn't know\nis I brought a lighter, and I'm gonna drop it for somebody. - What, what, what? - One and a half minutes remaining. (Yoshi licking sounds) - Let's get it, baby. Yeah, yeah. - Oh my gosh, this is the first\nperfect umbrella I've seen. - Oh yeah, easy peasy. - Whoo! - Six, seven, okay, she passed. She does have plot armor. - [Woman] Almost there. - So close, 30 seconds. - Oh my God. - Are you serious? - Three, two, one. Time is up. - You did it? You did the umbrella? - And just like that, all these players have been eliminated. But don't worry because\nthey're all walking away with $2,000 in cash. 142 of you survived honeycomb. (crowd cheering) And if you leave in the next five minutes, I'll give you $4,000. Let's weed out some of the weak people. $4,000. - Thank you. - I was not expecting this many people. There we go, head on out. And with that, I'm gonna need you all to\nsplit up into groups of 10. We had them form teams\nbecause next up is tug of war. - This could determine your chance at half a million dollars. - We needed the strongest\npeople and the smartest people. We have intelligence, skill, and brawn. - We trying to recruit the biggest people, so we can get real\nstrong and pull the rope. - Sorry, no girls allowed. - Oh, no girls allowed, boo, okay. - I just sent three people off. We got 10 now let's go. - Let's go! - I should have taken the four grand. - We now have 12 different\ngroups of 10 people. Let's move on to the next game. And now let's decide who faces who? (contestants cheering) Okay, we're gonna draw one from here. Six, we'll just draw this one. Five, okay. Follow me to the bridge. And now the moment\nyou've been waiting for. A game of tug of war. Team six versus team five. - Team five on three. One two, three, team five. - You've fall in the\nfoam, or your flag crosses to the other team's\nside. You're eliminated. Are you guys ready? - [All] Yeah! - Are you ready? - [All] Yeah! - All right, three, skip a few, go. - Pull! - Power! - Oh, it's going to team five right now. Team six is falling. Somebody's right at the edge. Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig. (crowd cheering) - Congratulations, team five, you have all moved on. Team number two versus team number seven. (team cheering) They seem happy. Team seven and two head on out. - You keep me alive,\nwe're gonna get the money. (team cheering) - Give it up, this team's winning. - Go, oh, it's already on right side. Hey, let's check in on 067. In the show you won, so let's see if it works here. And Karl, we have 067. You should just lose. - Karl no, give them motivation. - Pull! - Its over here, it crossed. (team cheering) Sir, can you come over here? Why don't you draw? Don't look, grab one from\nhere, and one from here, and then grab one from here. Team number four versus team number 10. (team cheering) If I was you guys, I'd be terrified, 'cause they have 456. He's literally the main character. - Let's go! - Three, two, one, go. Oh, they're getting, oh. Oh, it's going over to 456. They're falling. They're dropping They all just fell. Obviously we have no way of rigging it, but 456 and 067 both survived tug of war. Let's draw, oh boy. Nine versus 11. (crowd cheering) In this game with team\nnine versus team eleven, they went so hard that this happened. They are going all out, look at them. Oh they're falling. Don't let them. Oh yes. Oh, they broke the set. They literally broke it. You guys can move on. Go ahead and head on now. Tug of war took us from\n120 people down to 60. And remember, only one of\nthese people is walking away with $456,000. All right, everybody. Can we have your attention? As you guys know from Squid Games, game number four is marbles. (contestants cheering) - I don't know if I'd be cheering, because instead of letting\nyou pick your partner, we're gonna make you partner\nwith your best friend. Throughout this entire challenge, we've been monitoring who\nyou've been talking to the most, and we're gonna make you\npartner up with them. And only one of you can move on. For example, 067 and 431. - That's my best friend. - According to this, you two\nare roommates and best friends. We did our research. - I have to come home\nto the house we live in at the end of the day, gonna be a bit awkward. - Wouldn't be able to\ndo it without you, man. - We couldn't have done\nit without each other. - I'm glad I'm with you at the end. - [Mr. Beast] Everybody\ngets a bag of 10 marbles, and they have to agree\non a game to play it against their best friend. 20 marbles lets them move on. But by winning, they\neliminate their best friend. Go ahead and start the timer. You can play whatever game you want, but you need 20 to leave. A lot of pairs went with marble games that were played in Squid Game. - Odd. - Even. - Odd or even? - Even on that side. - What? What game are you playing? - We don't know. One marble at a time,\nit's gonna take all day. - If you keep talking, it might. - Okay. - [Mr. Beast] And other\ngroups got creative. - What is this game? - We're throwing it at the bricks, right? If you get the middle one\nright there, that's one point. But if you hit the bricks in the behind, then its three points. Everything else is no points\nuntil the clock runs down, Whoever has most points is the winner. - All right, well good\nluck with your game. - But one group just\nwanted to get it over with. You're doing even odds for all of it. Yo, he looks so intense. - He's got one marble. - Are you sure? - Oh, he got it, oh my gosh. Congratulations on winning. I'll see you in the next round. - You're good buddy, you're good, okay? - I'm so sad. - Why are you sad? It's gonna be okay. - We promised each other we were not gonna screw each other over. I didn't even know we\nwere gonna be this close. - I'm doing this for my\nfamily, but I'm nervous. - Best man's gonna win. - Best man win man. - Best man's gonna win. - [Mr. Beast] Everybody,\nyou've got five minutes left. - Don't look at me. - They want to put\n$465,000 Up to a coin flip. - You had to make it sound like that, huh? Tails. - It's tails. - Yo, oh no. - Odd? - I'll give you the honor of\neliminating your best friend. - Oh no, that's even worse. - Ah. - Aww. - It doesn't hurt. Before I eliminate you, I wanna let the viewers\nknow that someone random that subscribes in the next\nseven days is getting $10,000. So if you haven't already,\nhit the subscribe button okay? - Can I do it? - Go for it. Just hit right there. - Oh. - Don't fall, they're so dramatic. So if you haven't already subscribe and you could win 10 grand. What game are we playing? - Closest to the wall. - A minute and 15 seconds remain. When that hits zero, if you're in here, you're eliminated. - I have one more question to ask. - What's up, man? - You promise to remember me? - Oh my gosh. - What do you mean? - You're literally both\nabout to get eliminated. Oh, what was that? - Why'd you do that? - You sure?\n- Yeah. - He has been eliminated, thank you, sir. - I love you, man. - The time has hit zero. Everyone in here is eliminated. Congratulations on surviving marbles. At this point in the real show, there was an all out\nbrawl to thin the numbers. So instead we're gonna play Ddakji. You have to use this blue piece of paper to flip that red one on\nthe ground by throwing it. The first 16 of you to\nflip your red square moves on to glass bridge, which is personally my favorite game. Everyone throw. Oh wow, we didn't even get anyone. And while they're\nfighting for their chance in this competition, I wanna tell you guys about Brawl Stars, who helped fund this video, which cost over three and\na half million dollars. Thank you so much. Throw. - Yes! - Brawl Stars is a mobile\ngame you can play at home, on the go, in this\narena, wherever you want against millions of\npeople across the world. Oh, we got some. Congratulations. It's three minutes of\nadrenaline filled mayhem, and they have 12 different game modes, including their own battle Royale, which is kind of similar\nto what we're doing here. - Yes!\n- Yes! - Yeah, let's go. - We have nine winners so far, which means only seven places remain. You said you played Brawl Stars? - We both do. - Oh, you both play Brawl Stars? What are your thoughts on Brawl Stars? - That it's pretty fun. It's a mobile game, you can\ndownload it on Android or Apple. - I didn't tell him to say this. - Lets go! - Yeah! - Yo, the main characters survived. As you can see, you see the Brawl Stars logo, he did it. They have over 50 different\ncharacters you can play as, from a vintage driven robot\nto a cactus named spike, that kind of looks like Nolan. - Hey. - And like all our\ncontestants here are leaving with $2,000 for free today. Every single person that plays Brawl Stars within the next seven days, I will personally be\ngiving you a free prize. So if you haven't already, go download it. If you yell \"Thank you, Brawl Stars.\" Before you throw, I hear you'll flip it. - [Contestants] Thank you Brawl Stars! - Oh, it worked for him. - Oh my God, it's true. - Thank you, Brawl Stars. - And for the 14 of you\nthat didn't flip it, I'm gonna have to eliminate you. Oh, that was so in sync, oh my gosh. Now can all of you winners turn around. Thank you, and now you\ncan turn around again. We just filled the room with\n16 different mannequins, and here's the thing. They're actually in a random order. And the numbers on them are in Korean. And the number they get here is what order they have\nto cross in glass bridge. In a timely and orderly\nfashion. You can all go. First come, first serve. What'd you get? Oh, she got one. Oh. - 15, okay. - All right, if you wanna\njust go ahead and leave now. Everyone has a vest with numbers,\nlet's go to glass bridge. We are now at the glass bridge set, and look at how insane this thing looks. It is amazing. And bring out the contestants. I can't wait to see the\nlook on their faces. - [Contestant] Oh, what? Oh my God. - Players, welcome to glass bridge. (contestants cheering) There is two platforms you can jump on. One will drop you, and one will hold you. Start the timer. Begin the challenge. - Okay. - Let's go, girl. - I'm sticking with the\nguys I'm sticking with. I'm sticking, I'm sticking. - All right, she survived the first jump. Okay, they are one for one so far. - Go right? - I'm always right. - Okay. - I don't know if I'd listen to Chris. - Chris, this is on you. - Hey, victory. - We had our first loss. If you're wondering where\nshe just fell, don't worry, there's a giant foam pit\ndown there, she's fine. Well now, now you know. Now you know left. - Come on, 13 Minutes guys. - We now have three\npeople on the platform. Only one out so far. - I'm not moving. I want somebody past eight\nto take the next step. - Past eight?

(All clamoring) - Take a leap of faith, come on, come on. - You're up. - I can't jump, they're in my way.

This will determine which\none of you wins 456 grand, Karl, kick the music on. (ominous music)\nHey, let it play a little bit, Karl. Lets let them soak in it. Karl's not looking at them. He has no idea where\nthey are on the chair. - Somebody's gonna get $456,000\nbecause you pause the music. - Oh boy. Oh, this is, oh the intensity. When will he pause it? When's he gonna pause it? - Yo, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

Red light. - Only two minutes remain. - Karl makes me way too nervous. - Green light. Red light. - We have under one minute remaining. Time's ticking, green light. Red light. You have stepped on\nthe line, you are good. You're good. You're good. - Lets go! - Red light. (gun shot) It worked, it worked, we got em. You're definitely out. Dude, I knew that would work, green light. Red light. You're definitely, so\nmany of you just got out. - They gotta run faster. - They've gotta, you gotta sprint. - Green light. Green light. I'm not even gonna say red light, I'm not saying red light. Ah, its too late. Too late. (crowd cheering) - Whoa. - Holy crap. - Congratulations on surviving\nred light green light. (contestants cheering) So if you look at this TV, you'll see that only (TV twinkling) 232 of you survived. If you look above your head, you'll see the $456,000\nyou're competing for. And now let's move on to honeycomb. In honeycomb, everyone gets a needle, and a cookie with a different shape on it, and they have 10 minutes to remove the shape from the cookie. But if they break the\nshape, they're eliminated. All right, so everybody\nI'm gonna need you to get in the line in front of one of these question marks. (tense music) Why did you pick this one? - Just like, the middle. - Basically you don't think it's umbrella. - There's an umbrella? - Did you even watch Squid Game? - So many of these people\nare about to get out. - Reveal shape number one. (contestants cheering) - Reveal the second symbol. (contestants cheering) Look at how hype they're getting. If I was you, I'd be\ngetting pretty nervous. Reveal it! (contestants cheering) Chris, go for it. - No! - I know umbrella going home. That's all I got to say. - We got the circle. Thank God\nwe didn't get the umbrella. (tense music) - You look pretty nervous over here. Even though you got the star, you're the main character. so you have plot armor, you're fine. Start the timer. The challenge is underway. You just hear them all scraping. - I hate my life. - I was taking it out of the tin, and it just snapped in half. - Lets see it. - It's working. (clock ticking) - Take your time. - You had an umbrella? - Yeah.\n- Sorry bud. - Look at this. We have\na successful triangle. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Oh no. - What Jimmy doesn't know\nis I brought a lighter, and I'm gonna drop it for somebody. - What, what, what? - One and a half minutes remaining. (Yoshi licking sounds) - Let's get it, baby. Yeah, yeah. - Oh my gosh, this is the first\nperfect umbrella I've seen. - Oh yeah, easy peasy. - Whoo! - Six, seven, okay, she passed. She does have plot armor. - [Woman] Almost there. - So close, 30 seconds. - Oh my God. - Are you serious? - Three, two, one. Time is up. - You did it? You did the umbrella? - And just like that, all these players have been eliminated. But don't worry because\nthey're all walking away with $2,000 in cash. 142 of you survived honeycomb. (crowd cheering) And if you leave in the next five minutes, I'll give you $4,000. Let's weed out some of the weak people. $4,000. - Thank you. - I was not expecting this many people. There we go, head on out. And with that, I'm gonna need you all to\nsplit up into groups of 10. We had them form teams\nbecause next up is tug of war. - This could determine your chance at half a million dollars. - We needed the strongest\npeople and the smartest people. We have intelligence, skill, and brawn. - We trying to recruit the biggest people, so we can get real\nstrong and pull the rope. - Sorry, no girls allowed. - Oh, no girls allowed, boo, okay. - I just sent three people off. We got 10 now let's go. - Let's go! - I should have taken the four grand. - We now have 12 different\ngroups of 10 people. Let's move on to the next game. And now let's decide who faces who? (contestants cheering) Okay, we're gonna draw one from here. Six, we'll just draw this one. Five, okay. Follow me to the bridge. And now the moment\nyou've been waiting for. A game of tug of war. Team six versus team five. - Team five on three. One two, three, team five. - You've fall in the\nfoam, or your flag crosses to the other team's\nside. You're eliminated. Are you guys ready? - [All] Yeah! - Are you ready? - [All] Yeah! - All right, three, skip a few, go. - Pull! - Power! - Oh, it's going to team five right now. Team six is falling. Somebody's right at the edge. Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig. (crowd cheering) - Congratulations, team five, you have all moved on. Team number two versus team number seven. (team cheering) They seem happy. Team seven and two head on out. - You keep me alive,\nwe're gonna get the money. (team cheering) - Give it up, this team's winning. - Go, oh, it's already on right side. Hey, let's check in on 067. In the show you won, so let's see if it works here. And Karl, we have 067. You should just lose. - Karl no, give them motivation. - Pull! - Its over here, it crossed. (team cheering) Sir, can you come over here? Why don't you draw? Don't look, grab one from\nhere, and one from here, and then grab one from here. Team number four versus team number 10. (team cheering) If I was you guys, I'd be terrified, 'cause they have 456. He's literally the main character. - Let's go! - Three, two, one, go. Oh, they're getting, oh. Oh, it's going over to 456. They're falling. They're dropping They all just fell. Obviously we have no way of rigging it, but 456 and 067 both survived tug of war. Let's draw, oh boy. Nine versus 11. (crowd cheering) In this game with team\nnine versus team eleven, they went so hard that this happened. They are going all out, look at them. Oh they're falling. Don't let them. Oh yes. Oh, they broke the set. They literally broke it. You guys can move on. Go ahead and head on now. Tug of war took us from\n120 people down to 60. And remember, only one of\nthese people is walking away with $456,000. All right, everybody. Can we have your attention? As you guys know from Squid Games, game number four is marbles. (contestants cheering) - I don't know if I'd be cheering, because instead of letting\nyou pick your partner, we're gonna make you partner\nwith your best friend. Throughout this entire challenge, we've been monitoring who\nyou've been talking to the most, and we're gonna make you\npartner up with them. And only one of you can move on. For example, 067 and 431. - That's my best friend. - According to this, you two\nare roommates and best friends. We did our research. - I have to come home\nto the house we live in at the end of the day, gonna be a bit awkward. - Wouldn't be able to\ndo it without you, man. - We couldn't have done\nit without each other. - I'm glad I'm with you at the end. - [Mr. Beast] Everybody\ngets a bag of 10 marbles, and they have to agree\non a game to play it against their best friend. 20 marbles lets them move on. But by winning, they\neliminate their best friend. Go ahead and start the timer. You can play whatever game you want, but you need 20 to leave. A lot of pairs went with marble games that were played in Squid Game. - Odd. - Even. - Odd or even? - Even on that side. - What? What game are you playing? - We don't know. One marble at a time,\nit's gonna take all day. - If you keep talking, it might. - Okay. - [Mr. Beast] And other\ngroups got creative. - What is this game? - We're throwing it at the bricks, right? If you get the middle one\nright there, that's one point. But if you hit the bricks in the behind, then its three points. Everything else is no points\nuntil the clock runs down, Whoever has most points is the winner. - All right, well good\nluck with your game. - But one group just\nwanted to get it over with. You're doing even odds for all of it. Yo, he looks so intense. - He's got one marble. - Are you sure? - Oh, he got it, oh my gosh. Congratulations on winning. I'll see you in the next round. - You're good buddy, you're good, okay? - I'm so sad. - Why are you sad? It's gonna be okay. - We promised each other we were not gonna screw each other over. I didn't even know we\nwere gonna be this close. - I'm doing this for my\nfamily, but I'm nervous. - Best man's gonna win. - Best man win man. - Best man's gonna win. - [Mr. Beast] Everybody,\nyou've got five minutes left. - Don't look at me. - They want to put\n$465,000 Up to a coin flip. - You had to make it sound like that, huh? Tails. - It's tails. - Yo, oh no. - Odd? - I'll give you the honor of\neliminating your best friend. - Oh no, that's even worse. - Ah. - Aww. - It doesn't hurt. Before I eliminate you, I wanna let the viewers\nknow that someone random that subscribes in the next\nseven days is getting $10,000. So if you haven't already,\nhit the subscribe button okay? - Can I do it? - Go for it. Just hit right there. - Oh. - Don't fall, they're so dramatic. So if you haven't already subscribe and you could win 10 grand. What game are we playing? - Closest to the wall. - A minute and 15 seconds remain. When that hits zero, if you're in here, you're eliminated. - I have one more question to ask. - What's up, man? - You promise to remember me? - Oh my gosh. - What do you mean? - You're literally both\nabout to get eliminated. Oh, what was that? - Why'd you do that? - You sure?\n- Yeah. - He has been eliminated, thank you, sir. - I love you, man. - The time has hit zero. Everyone in here is eliminated. Congratulations on surviving marbles. At this point in the real show, there was an all out\nbrawl to thin the numbers. So instead we're gonna play Ddakji. You have to use this blue piece of paper to flip that red one on\nthe ground by throwing it. The first 16 of you to\nflip your red square moves on to glass bridge, which is personally my favorite game. Everyone throw. Oh wow, we didn't even get anyone. And while they're\nfighting for their chance in this competition, I wanna tell you guys about Brawl Stars, who helped fund this video, which cost over three and\na half million dollars. Thank you so much. Throw. - Yes! - Brawl Stars is a mobile\ngame you can play at home, on the go, in this\narena, wherever you want against millions of\npeople across the world. Oh, we got some. Congratulations. It's three minutes of\nadrenaline filled mayhem, and they have 12 different game modes, including their own battle Royale, which is kind of similar\nto what we're doing here. - Yes!\n- Yes! - Yeah, let's go. - We have nine winners so far, which means only seven places remain. You said you played Brawl Stars? - We both do. - Oh, you both play Brawl Stars? What are your thoughts on Brawl Stars? - That it's pretty fun. It's a mobile game, you can\ndownload it on Android or Apple. - I didn't tell him to say this. - Lets go! - Yeah! - Yo, the main characters survived. As you can see, you see the Brawl Stars logo, he did it. They have over 50 different\ncharacters you can play as, from a vintage driven robot\nto a cactus named spike, that kind of looks like Nolan. - Hey. - And like all our\ncontestants here are leaving with $2,000 for free today. Every single person that plays Brawl Stars within the next seven days, I will personally be\ngiving you a free prize. So if you haven't already, go download it. If you yell \"Thank you, Brawl Stars.\" Before you throw, I hear you'll flip it. - [Contestants] Thank you Brawl Stars! - Oh, it worked for him. - Oh my God, it's true. - Thank you, Brawl Stars. - And for the 14 of you\nthat didn't flip it, I'm gonna have to eliminate you. Oh, that was so in sync, oh my gosh. Now can all of you winners turn around. Thank you, and now you\ncan turn around again. We just filled the room with\n16 different mannequins, and here's the thing. They're actually in a random order. And the numbers on them are in Korean. And the number they get here is what order they have\nto cross in glass bridge. In a timely and orderly\nfashion. You can all go. First come, first serve. What'd you get? Oh, she got one. Oh. - 15, okay. - All right, if you wanna\njust go ahead and leave now. Everyone has a vest with numbers,\nlet's go to glass bridge. We are now at the glass bridge set, and look at how insane this thing looks. It is amazing. And bring out the contestants. I can't wait to see the\nlook on their faces. - [Contestant] Oh, what? Oh my God. - Players, welcome to glass bridge. (contestants cheering) There is two platforms you can jump on. One will drop you, and one will hold you. Start the timer. Begin the challenge. - Okay. - Let's go, girl. - I'm sticking with the\nguys I'm sticking with. I'm sticking, I'm sticking. - All right, she survived the first jump. Okay, they are one for one so far. - Go right? - I'm always right. - Okay. - I don't know if I'd listen to Chris. - Chris, this is on you. - Hey, victory. - We had our first loss. If you're wondering where\nshe just fell, don't worry, there's a giant foam pit\ndown there, she's fine. Well now, now you know. Now you know left. - Come on, 13 Minutes guys. - We now have three\npeople on the platform. Only one out so far. - I'm not moving. I want somebody past eight\nto take the next step. - Past eight?

All right, two, he took the L for you. - Adio time two. - Hey honestly, hey two,\nif you're three for three, you might as well keep going. Clearly, you're lucky. - Oh my God, all right. - [Mr. Beast] No pushing,\nobviously, please. - Come on. - Two bit the bullet. - Two's gone. - Under eight minutes. You've still got a ton of ground to cover. - Yeah, he's good. - I don't understand why number 10 went in front of everyone. That was dumb. - Come on buddy. - Yo did 10 make it again? - All right, it looks like\nnumber four is gonna go. - Six minutes remaining. - I'm doing this for the girls. - Let's salute all the fallen people. All right, continue. Under five minutes left. Tons of jumps. This is gonna get intense. - Oh, that was crazy. - No ten's gone, no. - [Mr. Beast] Another one gone. - All right, don't move bud, don't move. - I'm not moving. - Your odds don't look\nback there right now. - Nah, I'm not moving. I'm not moving. - All right, just like\nwe thought would happen, They're refusing to move. Let's see who budges. - I'm pretty good where I am. - Lets go. - You got it. - Oh, he got it. - All right, no, not a chance, come on. - When are y'all big\nnumbers taking a chance? - Under three minutes\nwith four jumps left. - Somebody's gonna have to do it. Y'all are in a real bad spot. I'm not moving. - What are y'all big numbers\ntaking a leap of faith? - Hey, how are you doing back there, 15? - Whatever, man, we could all lose. - You guys better hurry up. - They have two minutes,\nwhy are they not rushing? - If you go, I'll take the next one. - All right.\n- Come on. - You jumping? - Y'all really got me scared, but hold up bro. This is a real life decision. - 90 seconds, one and a half minutes. - Come on now, come on, come on, come on. - Six. - Jump, jump, jump. Oh, you passed. - I ain't moving, I am not moving. Y'all, there's a God\ntelling me I'm not moving. - One minute remaining. Three jumps, one minute. Hey, you guys in the back, if you're not here when\nit hits zero, you're gone. - I took my leap of faith, now I'm gonna stay right here and be cozy. - Hurry, go. - Y'all go. - [Mr. Beast] It's just three. (All clamoring) - Take a leap of faith, come on, come on. - You're up. - I can't jump, they're in my way.

Thank you for coming out. And all of you are moving\nonto the final game. They're competing for $456,000, let's go. Congratulations on\nmaking it to the top six.

Exactly, that's why we're\ndoing musical chairs instead, because we're not Korean, start circling. Start the music. Karl, you can stop it whenever you want. Karl do not look. Chris, don't look. Karl isn't looking so we can't be biased. All right, let's see what happens. Oh, oh he got it. - I got more, man. I'm pretty sure.\n- He's way more. I'm sorry about that.

And they range from the age one all the way through age 100. And I've trapped each of them\nin their very own glass cube. The last one to leave\ntheir cube is going to win half a million dollars. The challenge has officially begun. Let's see which age is the best. - So, I'm representing for 31. I've got the best view\nand the best motivation. - You want the best?\nYou got it right here. - My daughter's turning\nthree this Saturday. Emery, daddy loves you, this is for you. - 69, feeling fine. And I gotta winning on my mind. - Boing, boing, boing. - What's your strategy\nto win this challenge? Keep in mind, I have over 300 cameras set up literally everywhere, so we'll be monitoring their every move. And one of the first things I noticed was that the kids had a crazy strategy. - My strategy is to make a lot of noise, so people like don't get any sleep and they really wanna get out. - And, I can't believe\nit, but it's working. The old people were not having it, and they started leaving right away. - Can somebody make that\ngirl stop screaming? - And even some of the kids got out because of it. - He's building up suspense.\n- No! - Did you want the money?\n- Yeah. - Then why did we leave? - I have good news for you. You've survived longer\nthan the one year old. - That, don't, come on. - Do you think this will be easy? - I am a World War II veteran. It'll be peanuts. - True.\nI appreciate your service. Thank you. We're a couple hours into the challenge and 10 people have already gotten out. So, we decide to leave them\nalone for the rest of the day, which caused even more people to get out. - I want to go home. I want to see my kids. Bye. - I gotta go to school. - I just don't think\nit's for me at my age. - I got really bored and I miss my dog. - Here's some money for playing. - Oh, are you serious? - But, some people were\nmore determined to stay. - You know, I'm a big family guy. Hopefully, pay off my\nsister's student debt. - I have a deal with one of my grandkids. I'm here to show him\nhow strong I am at 70. - I don't need a strategy,\nI'm good 'til Christmas. - It's the start of day two, and only 76 people remain. Let's see how the a\nhundred year old's doing. How's it going? - I'm awake! - It's the start of day two. Do you want to keep going\nor do you want to get out? - I think I'm gonna quit. It's something my family\nwill never forget. - You fought in a World War, and competed in a Mr. Beast video. - Yes. - Going into day two,\nI've been pretty good. - The money's right there. It's right there, within my reach. - Whoa, how are you growing\nso much on the walls? - Chap stick. - It's always amazing to see how people fight their boredom in these last to leave challenges. Some draw on the walls with deodorant, while others build pillow forts. So, I'm gonna give them an opportunity to take this challenge to the next level. We're 24 hours in, and\nit's time for a vote. In each of your rooms you'll notice a green button and a red button. And if a majority of you\npress the green button, we'll do a challenge, but that will eliminate a bunch of you. If a majority of you press the red button, we won't, and we'll\njust continue as usual. - I chose red. Why take unnecessary risks? - Not voting green. - I am ready to do something\nand get some people out here. - Green is we do a challenge. Red it-\nOkay. - Reveal the results. 63 people voted for a\nchallenge and 13 didn't. - I've got my game face on today. - The game is three cup monte, but we made it slightly bigger. A ball is placed under\none of these three cups. Nolan, Chandler, start moving 'em around. Whoever remembers where the\nball is, stays in the game. Everyone else is eliminated. - The guys are so cute, it's hard to keep my eyes on the cups. - Have you ever seen\nsomeone that focused before? What's that over there? - You are unbelievably tricky. - Oh, my gosh, what's that over there? - Not falling for that. - It worked on the 82 year old. Do you have any idea which cup it's in? I guess it's up to chance. But some people lost track of the ball and had to trust their\nneighbor for the answer. - It's like you blink or\nyou look away for a second and it's gone. - We relied on a consensus here. - New strategy.\n- What? - We're not gonna tell\n'em the correct thing. When they ask, it's a different color. - I trust my people, I think I'm good. - I'm nervous because I\ndon't wanna get kicked out. - They've been watching these cups for an hour straight. If they still know which\ncup the ball is under, that's really impressive. Everyone, I need you\nto lock in your votes. Hit the button that lines\nup with the cup you choose. - I don't know who to trust. - Green. - He said red.\n- Red. - She said blue.\n- Blue. - Don't trust her! - I don't trust the\nman over there, at all. - You're done, big boy, done. - Reveal what color they picked. Only three people picked green. Nolan, were those three people right? They were not. Most people picked blue. Let's see if they're right. They are! - We're out.\n- We're outta here. - By the end of the challenge on day two, only 52 people still remain. And the tensions are getting higher. - We got an enemy now, the old guy. - I know, look at him. - There's friction\nbetween these two groups. - He told me red.\nShe told me the truth. - These are the people\nhe's been talking to the whole time we're here. And they told him the wrong color. - Her and I were just playing with him, giving him the wrong color. We were just having fun with 'em. They took it the wrong way. - If you gotta win by lying, then that's not the way we want to play. - What they've done is, they've turned a bunch\nof folks against them. A bunch. - At this point, you're probably wondering\nhow they use the bathroom. Push this down. Okay, the light outside\nthe cube just turned on, which means Chris is now\ngonna bring you a toilet. I couldn't get plumbing\nin all hundred rooms, so we have portable toilets. This is now a bathroom. Let's get out of the\nbathroom, oh my goodness. - By the end of day two, almost half the contestants\nhave been eliminated. - It was fun to tell 'em the wrong color, 'cause they didn't know what to do. - Wait, why do you want\nnumber 22 out so bad? - We were beefing earlier. - Tension, now, is at an all time high. - Makes her want to get out. - You know it doesn't, right? - What?\nI can't hear you! - I'm hungry. Leave me alone, I'm hungry. - God, pissing me off. - Which naturally caused\nmore people to leave. - It's time to go home. - You got really far.\n- Thank you. - By the end of day three, 54 and 74 were the biggest targets. How's it going everybody? - Woo! - We're halfway through day four, which means it's time to\nvote on whether or not we do another challenge. If you vote yes, a lot of\npeople are gonna get out. This is not the same\nas the last challenge. So, vote with caution. How's it going?\nWhat'd you vote for? - Challenge. - You're not worried it could get you out? - I like to sow seeds of chaos. It's more fun this way. - Why are you pressing it so much? - Let's do the challenge. - All right. The results are in, and only nine voted against it. You each have a piece\nof paper and a sharpie. I want you all to write a number of one of the remaining\ncontestants on that paper. Whoever gets the most\nvotes, is eliminated. 60 second timer starts now. I told you this challenge would be brutal. - This is gonna stink. That's what's going through my head. - I'll betcha they're trying\nto vote me off right now. - In the last challenge, there was a lot of lying. So, now, the people that were lied to are gonna vote out the\npeople that lied to them, so it pays off to be honest. - What's your vote?\n- 54. His cockiness and his lying. - 74, she's not a very grateful person. Somebody needs to go, would be her. - You wrote that down quick. - Yes, we got his whole block. - So, everybody's voting for 54? - Yes. We're going to see who has more influence. - Things are about to\nget real interesting. - Everybody reveal your answer in three, two, one. Oh! I'm seeing a lot of same numbers up here. - There's such a big\nwar between 74 and 54. - The results are in. And it was actually scarily\nclose, within two votes. The loser is 74 with 14 votes. Nolan, can you please show 74 out. One down, now we need to\ndo that nine more times. - Woo! - We all just basically came\nto a consensus at the same time that 10 needs to go. - He's so annoying. Like, he literally voted for me and I didn't do anything to him. - That's a strong minded\nchild right there. If he stayed the whole time, he could win. - The ten year old's my favorite. I really hope he stays in. - Yeah, I'm thinking\nten, I'm so sorry ten. But, if I don't vote for\nyou, then they'd want me out. - I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think he voted for me. - Three, two, one. All right, everyone, show\nyour vote to the camera. - Savages. Savages.\n- Oh, my gosh. That is a lot of tens. I'm sorry, little man. This is officially the\nfirst decade eliminated. - You guys are sick in the head! - You outlasted this entire row. The only reason they voted you out was cause they were scared. - I felt so bad for ten, I\ninvited him onstage with me to co-host the rest of the challenge. - He's probably gonna kick me out. - Okay, I need every single\none of you to vote for 14. - 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14. - I don't know how to put this, but almost everyone voted for 14. - We have to think in terms of who's the biggest threat, and this one's gonna be tough. Get ready. - It's time to go. - The 50 year olds were\ndetermined to eliminate people, and they had the most voting power by far. - 73 is also one of those bad apples. - 73.\n15 Votes. - They got a pretty big\npower block right there. - Oh, my god. The 50s might single handedly take out everybody in their 70s. - 71?\nOkay. - 71 got 15 votes. - I've never been so\nthreatened by 50 year olds. - It's kind of scary. We lost some good friends. Hate to see them go. - I hate doing this.\nIt was 75. - This is insane. - I wanna say, everyone voted 69. - I feel so sorry for you. - 69, you've been voted out. - Look at what you've done. - The next person is 35, with nine votes. - We randomly chose. - And I'm sorry to say, 21. - We can only all be friends for so long. - I'm actually seeing a lot of 96, so let's go hear what she has to say. She was very close to being eliminated. - Great, this is what you want, I'm happy. - Dude, she's so cute. The fact that she's sweet, tells me that I know her\ngrandkids miss her at home. - My arms. My arms. - Let's see who you savages dog piled on. Show the numbers. Over half of you voted for 96. I don't understand you people. She's not the biggest threat here. - Oh. I'm sorry.\n- Thank you for everything. You know, it's the way\nit is, and I'm happy. You know, it's what everybody wants, and that's what's important. - This is heart wrenching. - The purge is now officially done. If you're in your cube, you survived. Because of their alliance,\nthe 50s made it through the entire voting game untouched. And, yet again, somehow 54 survived. - On to the next. - Either challenge or no challenge. - I gotta vote no challenge,\n'cause I can wait it out. - It's time for another challenge vote. - I know for a hundred percent I can win if I do no challenges\nthe rest of the time. - I vote yes for challenge. My chances are getting better and better just like everybody else's. - I could wait it out. My house would be paid off. I'm ready to retire. This could be it for me. - 20 of you voted for a challenge. Why are you gambling? You guys are crazy. Inside of each of your\ncubes is a Jenga tower. We're gonna pull blocks out one at a time, and, if your tower\nfalls, you're eliminated. Pull your first block. It can be any block besides the red ones. We're gonna keep doing this until there is only ten people remaining. Pull the second block out. Looks like no one has been eliminated yet. Let's do another one. - My heartbeat is so fast. - I'm just waiting to hear\nthe crash of Jenga blocks. - That was close- Oh, my gosh, I called it. One person down, 14 more to be eliminated. This is gonna be crazy. And, while they're pulling pieces, I wanna tell you about the Shop app. It's the most amazing way\nto shop from your phone. The Shop app makes shopping extremely fun. From buying Feastables bars, to e-bikes, to whatever else you're interested in, it's super easy. And, when you're ready to buy, you can speed through\ncheckout using Shop Pay. - It's not coming out. - The Shop app uses AI technology to scan hundreds of millions of products, and recommend the ones best for you. I'm so nervous. - So am I. - Oh. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. - I can't touch- - Oh. Shop will even track all\nyour packages in one place so you'll know exactly\nwhen each of them arrive. And, remember, we're doing this until there are ten people left. - Yeah, whoa! - What are you doing?\n- Nothing. - You can't be trusted. - Oh. I bumped into the thing. - Yeah, I noticed. - Only one more to go. - It all comes down to this. She could be the last person. - I can't believe this hasn't\nhit the ground already. - I know, whoa. Bro, your tower has tilted 30 times. I can't look, I can't, oh, I gotta look. But I can't look, I gotta look. - Come on, Brenda, think\nabout the backyard Jenga. - Backyard Jenga don't have Jimmy in my- - That is the final elimination. - I can't believe it. I'm top 10. 90 gone, ten left, let's go. - If mom wins the $500,000, we are going to Disney World. - Download the Shop app right now. We're gonna be selling Jenga blocks and other parts from\nthis set on the Shop app, which I'll tell you more\nabout at the end of the video. This challenge has eliminated\neveryone above the age of 60. The right side of the map is a wasteland. And, now that 15 people just got out, we have to tear down 15 cubes. There's no way they're gonna vote for another challenge tomorrow. Look at how many people have gotten out. Every single one of these\nXs used to be a person. - There was a human right here. - There is no one around me. - I'm the youngest one here. - If I leave, I leave on a challenge. I'm not leaving walking out. - I have not come this far to give up. - I'm gonna let you guys say\nyour votes over the microphone. Do you want a challenge? - Absolutely. - Yes or no? - Yes.\n- Yes. - Challenge. - Yes or no? - Yes.\n- We're doing a challenge. - Mic drop.\n- Mic drop. - In our Squid Games video, you guys loved the marble\ngame, so we brought it back. Just like last time, the\ncontestants are playing one v. one against their neighbor. Each player's given ten marbles, and they choose what game to play. By the end of 30 minutes, only the person with 20 marbles moves on. These guys just wanted\nto get in over with. - This is a $500,000 coin flip. - Oh.\n- Oh. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm\nso sorry, it is heads. - First to two wins, right? It's up to you guys. Oh, my God, sunk it, that's one point. Oh. If you make it into any\nbucket, you win right here. - Let's go. - Oh, my God, he won it. - I'm sorry, buddy. - All good, all good. - Count 'em up. Make sure you have 20. - Got ten blue, nine red. - You're missing a marble? - Can you count again? - 19, you are one short. - I'm not holding onto any. - Interesting. There's only seven minutes left, so if you care for this\nman, you should find it. - Where is it? - You're currently at 18 marbles. And you're at two marbles. - I'm leaving this in your hands. - It's okay. - I'm so sorry. Oh, good. - Whoa. There might be a comeback. - It might be. - I found it. - Really? - Yeah.\n- Oh, really? - It was in my bed sheet. - He has one more marble. If you win with that one\nmarble, that'd be crazy. I thought that was in. - That's it.\n- Oh. - I can officially step out now. Oh, that feels so bad. - This keeps going back and forth. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Rock, paper, scissors. Hey, remember, you said we'd both go home, so one of us is gonna have\nto decide a different game. - Rock, paper, scissors for\nhalf a minute is bad too. - Okay, this is for all the marbles. We're gonna do all or nothing. Does that sound fair? - This is for all the marbles?\n- Yeah. - But you have 14 marbles and he has six. Why are you gambling? - All or nothing, a minute and a half. - Hurry up. - Rock, paper, scissors, turn! - I got 'em all. - 54 escaped elimination again. 30 seconds remain. - Okay, we're done to the last two. It was the same position as\nthis only a couple minutes ago. - And, the thing is, a\nminute ago it was me. - Is there anything you wanna\nsay to each other before this? - I love you.\n- I love you too. Let's just do this, right? - It's okay, congratulations. Can I hug her?\n- Yeah. - I lost to an amazing person. - It was rough. - The only people left are 23, 40, 43, 52, and 54. - Look at the graveyard of Xs. These were all cubes\nlike mine at the start. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous. - Things have been getting\na little more intense. - Today is my daughter's birthday. It's just hitting home now\nthat I'm not gonna be there. - Can you all hear me? - Yes. - When we started, there was a 100 of you, and now we're down to five. Do you wanna reduce it even\nfurther with a challenge? - Yes! - All right, but you guys chose this. In this challenge, the 95 contestants who have already left will vote. And the three of you with\nthe most votes are gone. - Wow. - I'm definitely worried\nabout this challenge. - Certain people here have kind of brushed people the wrong way. - You have no idea what\npeople think of you. - At this point, I'm rather glad that I didn't really make any enemies. - Do you think the people\nthat lost liked you? - For the most part. - Are you willing to bet\nhalf a million dollars that they liked you? - I don't know about that one. - Do you think the people that\nwere eliminated liked you? - No.\n- What's not to like? - Let's find out. We literally asked every single one of the\n95 eliminated people who they want gone. - Heart's about to jump outta my throat. - How many votes does it say you got, Joe? - Ten. - Which is not enough to be eliminated! He's one of the two that passed. Which means only one of\nthese four cubes remains. So, I'm bad with this stuff, do you wanna, you wanna handle it?\nYou got it. - 23.\n- Yes? - You were, in fact, eliminated. - No. To lose it in top five, when I've come as far, was super painful. - I really didn't expect 23 to go. - And, now, only one\nof these three remain. Do you think it's you? - I hope so. - That didn't sound confident. You received 15 votes. - Oh. - Oh, this is brutal. - Love you, Chris. - I'm not gonna lie, losing\nout on that was crushing. After spending, roughly, seven days here, and getting that close\nto that grand prize, and not getting it, it hurts. - And, now, the two of you. All right, we'll come over here. - This is tense. Very tense. - 54. - I got the most votes, I know. - Wait, how'd you know that? - I don't trust the\nman over there, at all. - You're done, big boy, done. - I just know. - Yeah, you did.\nYou got 37 votes. - So, I'm in?\n- Which means, 52, you passed! - I'm in! This was a once in a lifetime chance. - I've got a 50% chance at\nwinning half a million dollars. - As a reward for making\nit to the final two, I have one last surprise for you. What do you think it is? - Oh, I have no idea. - What is this right here? - That's for my daughter. - Today's her birthday? Well, let's see what comes\nthrough the curtains. - Don't do this to me. Oh, my God. - I'm not gonna let you miss her birthday. - Is that your daddy? - Regardless if you win or lose, we're proud of you, you can do this. - Good job! - This is the fam. - Hi! - I couldn't ask for anything else. That was my everything right there. - Yeah. I've got this now. - Only ages 52 and 40 remain, and they've been living in\nthese cubes for over a week. - Day eight. It's been a wild ride. - Here I am. I can't believe it. Every challenge I've\nsaid, I thought I was out. I thought I was out. I made it. - It's a lot more feasible now in my mind, because it's not me\nversus 98 other people. It's me versus one person. - All these Xs were\ncubes with people in 'em, and everybody's gone now,\nand it's just Joe and I. - Another day here is not\ngonna make somebody quit. To come down to something actually forcing one of us to leave. - I give them a chance to say no to a challenge, but- - Oh, my, what should we do? - I can't believe they chose a challenge. They are taking a half\na million dollar gamble. Inside one of these briefcases, is the check for $500,000. And everyone on set is blindfolded, including the cameramen,\nwhile I mix up the cases. I promise this will make\nsense in just a minute. The briefcases are now mixed. And, because you guys chose a challenge, you can step outta your\ncubes and meet in the middle. Half a million dollars is\nabout to go to 52 or 40. I'm going to flip a coin to decide who gets to look inside\nof their briefcase, making them the only person on set that knows where the money is. - It's a game of bluffery. - That's right, because, then, it's up to the other person to choose which briefcase they want to take home. Heads or tails? - Heads. - Tails. Whenever you're ready,\nlook inside your briefcase. I don't even want to know what's in there. I can't stand the burden. 52 now has to decide whether she's gonna keep her\nbriefcase or steal his. - Joe, do you have\n$500,000 in your briefcase? - Yes. - Joe, are you lying? - What do you think? - Was there anything\nelse in the briefcase, other than the money? - I saw the Mr. Beast logo. - You saw a check in there? - Yes. - Joe, are you honest? - You spent enough time\nwith me, what do you think? - This is so nerve wracking. Half a million dollars on the line. Is she going to keep her\nbriefcase or take his? - Wow. - It's a big decision. - What do you think, as of\nright now, in your head? Do you think it's in there? - I don't think it's in there. I think I have it. - I'm so nervous. - I'm, actually, my heart is beating. I'm actually feeling anxious for you guys. - And you swear that the\nmoney is in your case? - Yes. - I don't think it's in there. I think I'm gonna pick my case. - So, you're gonna keep this? - Locked in? - All right, Joe, what\nis inside your briefcase? Oh, my God! - I knew it!\n- Yeah! - And you told her it was in there. - I did. - This man literally said he had it. Oh, my gosh, what a crazy play. What is wrong with you? - He told the truth, and he got it. We said all along, the good guys can win. - It pays off to be honest. Even though you didn't win, we still wanna give you $10,000, and your family a trip to Disneyland to make losing a little better. They're still gonna go. - Yay! - We took items from the set and turned them into collectible pieces that we are selling for only one penny. And you have to act quickly, because there's only a\nlimited amount of 'em, and they're gonna sell out fast. Click the link below and\ndownload the Shop app right now.

And they range from the age one all the way through age 100. And I've trapped each of them\nin their very own glass cube. The last one to leave\ntheir cube is going to win half a million dollars. The challenge has officially begun. Let's see which age is the best. - So, I'm representing for 31. I've got the best view\nand the best motivation. - You want the best?\nYou got it right here. - My daughter's turning\nthree this Saturday. Emery, daddy loves you, this is for you. - 69, feeling fine. And I gotta winning on my mind. - Boing, boing, boing. - What's your strategy\nto win this challenge? Keep in mind, I have over 300 cameras set up literally everywhere, so we'll be monitoring their every move. And one of the first things I noticed was that the kids had a crazy strategy. - My strategy is to make a lot of noise, so people like don't get any sleep and they really wanna get out. - And, I can't believe\nit, but it's working. The old people were not having it, and they started leaving right away. - Can somebody make that\ngirl stop screaming? - And even some of the kids got out because of it. - He's building up suspense.\n- No! - Did you want the money?\n- Yeah. - Then why did we leave? - I have good news for you. You've survived longer\nthan the one year old. - That, don't, come on. - Do you think this will be easy? - I am a World War II veteran. It'll be peanuts. - True.\nI appreciate your service. Thank you. We're a couple hours into the challenge and 10 people have already gotten out. So, we decide to leave them\nalone for the rest of the day, which caused even more people to get out. - I want to go home. I want to see my kids. Bye. - I gotta go to school. - I just don't think\nit's for me at my age. - I got really bored and I miss my dog. - Here's some money for playing. - Oh, are you serious? - But, some people were\nmore determined to stay. - You know, I'm a big family guy. Hopefully, pay off my\nsister's student debt. - I have a deal with one of my grandkids. I'm here to show him\nhow strong I am at 70. - I don't need a strategy,\nI'm good 'til Christmas. - It's the start of day two, and only 76 people remain. Let's see how the a\nhundred year old's doing. How's it going? - I'm awake! - It's the start of day two. Do you want to keep going\nor do you want to get out? - I think I'm gonna quit. It's something my family\nwill never forget. - You fought in a World War, and competed in a Mr. Beast video. - Yes. - Going into day two,\nI've been pretty good. - The money's right there. It's right there, within my reach. - Whoa, how are you growing\nso much on the walls? - Chap stick. - It's always amazing to see how people fight their boredom in these last to leave challenges. Some draw on the walls with deodorant, while others build pillow forts. So, I'm gonna give them an opportunity to take this challenge to the next level. We're 24 hours in, and\nit's time for a vote. In each of your rooms you'll notice a green button and a red button. And if a majority of you\npress the green button, we'll do a challenge, but that will eliminate a bunch of you. If a majority of you press the red button, we won't, and we'll\njust continue as usual. - I chose red. Why take unnecessary risks? - Not voting green. - I am ready to do something\nand get some people out here. - Green is we do a challenge. Red it-\nOkay. - Reveal the results. 63 people voted for a\nchallenge and 13 didn't. - I've got my game face on today. - The game is three cup monte, but we made it slightly bigger. A ball is placed under\none of these three cups. Nolan, Chandler, start moving 'em around. Whoever remembers where the\nball is, stays in the game. Everyone else is eliminated. - The guys are so cute, it's hard to keep my eyes on the cups. - Have you ever seen\nsomeone that focused before? What's that over there? - You are unbelievably tricky. - Oh, my gosh, what's that over there? - Not falling for that. - It worked on the 82 year old. Do you have any idea which cup it's in? I guess it's up to chance. But some people lost track of the ball and had to trust their\nneighbor for the answer. - It's like you blink or\nyou look away for a second and it's gone. - We relied on a consensus here. - New strategy.\n- What? - We're not gonna tell\n'em the correct thing. When they ask, it's a different color. - I trust my people, I think I'm good. - I'm nervous because I\ndon't wanna get kicked out. - They've been watching these cups for an hour straight. If they still know which\ncup the ball is under, that's really impressive. Everyone, I need you\nto lock in your votes. Hit the button that lines\nup with the cup you choose. - I don't know who to trust. - Green. - He said red.\n- Red. - She said blue.\n- Blue. - Don't trust her! - I don't trust the\nman over there, at all. - You're done, big boy, done. - Reveal what color they picked. Only three people picked green. Nolan, were those three people right? They were not. Most people picked blue. Let's see if they're right. They are! - We're out.\n- We're outta here. - By the end of the challenge on day two, only 52 people still remain. And the tensions are getting higher. - We got an enemy now, the old guy. - I know, look at him. - There's friction\nbetween these two groups. - He told me red.\nShe told me the truth. - These are the people\nhe's been talking to the whole time we're here. And they told him the wrong color. - Her and I were just playing with him, giving him the wrong color. We were just having fun with 'em. They took it the wrong way. - If you gotta win by lying, then that's not the way we want to play. - What they've done is, they've turned a bunch\nof folks against them. A bunch. - At this point, you're probably wondering\nhow they use the bathroom. Push this down. Okay, the light outside\nthe cube just turned on, which means Chris is now\ngonna bring you a toilet. I couldn't get plumbing\nin all hundred rooms, so we have portable toilets. This is now a bathroom. Let's get out of the\nbathroom, oh my goodness. - By the end of day two, almost half the contestants\nhave been eliminated. - It was fun to tell 'em the wrong color, 'cause they didn't know what to do. - Wait, why do you want\nnumber 22 out so bad? - We were beefing earlier. - Tension, now, is at an all time high. - Makes her want to get out. - You know it doesn't, right? - What?\nI can't hear you! - I'm hungry. Leave me alone, I'm hungry. - God, pissing me off. - Which naturally caused\nmore people to leave. - It's time to go home. - You got really far.\n- Thank you. - By the end of day three, 54 and 74 were the biggest targets. How's it going everybody? - Woo! - We're halfway through day four, which means it's time to\nvote on whether or not we do another challenge. If you vote yes, a lot of\npeople are gonna get out. This is not the same\nas the last challenge. So, vote with caution. How's it going?\nWhat'd you vote for? - Challenge. - You're not worried it could get you out? - I like to sow seeds of chaos. It's more fun this way. - Why are you pressing it so much? - Let's do the challenge. - All right. The results are in, and only nine voted against it. You each have a piece\nof paper and a sharpie. I want you all to write a number of one of the remaining\ncontestants on that paper. Whoever gets the most\nvotes, is eliminated. 60 second timer starts now. I told you this challenge would be brutal. - This is gonna stink. That's what's going through my head. - I'll betcha they're trying\nto vote me off right now. - In the last challenge, there was a lot of lying. So, now, the people that were lied to are gonna vote out the\npeople that lied to them, so it pays off to be honest. - What's your vote?\n- 54. His cockiness and his lying. - 74, she's not a very grateful person. Somebody needs to go, would be her. - You wrote that down quick. - Yes, we got his whole block. - So, everybody's voting for 54? - Yes. We're going to see who has more influence. - Things are about to\nget real interesting. - Everybody reveal your answer in three, two, one. Oh! I'm seeing a lot of same numbers up here. - There's such a big\nwar between 74 and 54. - The results are in. And it was actually scarily\nclose, within two votes. The loser is 74 with 14 votes. Nolan, can you please show 74 out. One down, now we need to\ndo that nine more times. - Woo! - We all just basically came\nto a consensus at the same time that 10 needs to go. - He's so annoying. Like, he literally voted for me and I didn't do anything to him. - That's a strong minded\nchild right there. If he stayed the whole time, he could win. - The ten year old's my favorite. I really hope he stays in. - Yeah, I'm thinking\nten, I'm so sorry ten. But, if I don't vote for\nyou, then they'd want me out. - I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think he voted for me. - Three, two, one. All right, everyone, show\nyour vote to the camera. - Savages. Savages.\n- Oh, my gosh. That is a lot of tens. I'm sorry, little man. This is officially the\nfirst decade eliminated. - You guys are sick in the head! - You outlasted this entire row. The only reason they voted you out was cause they were scared. - I felt so bad for ten, I\ninvited him onstage with me to co-host the rest of the challenge. - He's probably gonna kick me out. - Okay, I need every single\none of you to vote for 14. - 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14. - I don't know how to put this, but almost everyone voted for 14. - We have to think in terms of who's the biggest threat, and this one's gonna be tough. Get ready. - It's time to go. - The 50 year olds were\ndetermined to eliminate people, and they had the most voting power by far. - 73 is also one of those bad apples. - 73.\n15 Votes. - They got a pretty big\npower block right there. - Oh, my god. The 50s might single handedly take out everybody in their 70s. - 71?\nOkay. - 71 got 15 votes. - I've never been so\nthreatened by 50 year olds. - It's kind of scary. We lost some good friends. Hate to see them go. - I hate doing this.\nIt was 75. - This is insane. - I wanna say, everyone voted 69. - I feel so sorry for you. - 69, you've been voted out. - Look at what you've done. - The next person is 35, with nine votes. - We randomly chose. - And I'm sorry to say, 21. - We can only all be friends for so long. - I'm actually seeing a lot of 96, so let's go hear what she has to say. She was very close to being eliminated. - Great, this is what you want, I'm happy. - Dude, she's so cute. The fact that she's sweet, tells me that I know her\ngrandkids miss her at home. - My arms. My arms. - Let's see who you savages dog piled on. Show the numbers. Over half of you voted for 96. I don't understand you people. She's not the biggest threat here. - Oh. I'm sorry.\n- Thank you for everything. You know, it's the way\nit is, and I'm happy. You know, it's what everybody wants, and that's what's important. - This is heart wrenching. - The purge is now officially done. If you're in your cube, you survived. Because of their alliance,\nthe 50s made it through the entire voting game untouched. And, yet again, somehow 54 survived. - On to the next. - Either challenge or no challenge. - I gotta vote no challenge,\n'cause I can wait it out. - It's time for another challenge vote. - I know for a hundred percent I can win if I do no challenges\nthe rest of the time. - I vote yes for challenge. My chances are getting better and better just like everybody else's. - I could wait it out. My house would be paid off. I'm ready to retire. This could be it for me. - 20 of you voted for a challenge. Why are you gambling? You guys are crazy. Inside of each of your\ncubes is a Jenga tower. We're gonna pull blocks out one at a time, and, if your tower\nfalls, you're eliminated. Pull your first block. It can be any block besides the red ones. We're gonna keep doing this until there is only ten people remaining. Pull the second block out. Looks like no one has been eliminated yet. Let's do another one. - My heartbeat is so fast. - I'm just waiting to hear\nthe crash of Jenga blocks. - That was close- Oh, my gosh, I called it. One person down, 14 more to be eliminated. This is gonna be crazy. And, while they're pulling pieces, I wanna tell you about the Shop app. It's the most amazing way\nto shop from your phone. The Shop app makes shopping extremely fun. From buying Feastables bars, to e-bikes, to whatever else you're interested in, it's super easy. And, when you're ready to buy, you can speed through\ncheckout using Shop Pay. - It's not coming out. - The Shop app uses AI technology to scan hundreds of millions of products, and recommend the ones best for you. I'm so nervous. - So am I. - Oh. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. - I can't touch- - Oh. Shop will even track all\nyour packages in one place so you'll know exactly\nwhen each of them arrive. And, remember, we're doing this until there are ten people left. - Yeah, whoa! - What are you doing?\n- Nothing. - You can't be trusted. - Oh. I bumped into the thing. - Yeah, I noticed. - Only one more to go. - It all comes down to this. She could be the last person. - I can't believe this hasn't\nhit the ground already. - I know, whoa. Bro, your tower has tilted 30 times. I can't look, I can't, oh, I gotta look. But I can't look, I gotta look. - Come on, Brenda, think\nabout the backyard Jenga. - Backyard Jenga don't have Jimmy in my- - That is the final elimination. - I can't believe it. I'm top 10. 90 gone, ten left, let's go. - If mom wins the $500,000, we are going to Disney World. - Download the Shop app right now. We're gonna be selling Jenga blocks and other parts from\nthis set on the Shop app, which I'll tell you more\nabout at the end of the video. This challenge has eliminated\neveryone above the age of 60. The right side of the map is a wasteland. And, now that 15 people just got out, we have to tear down 15 cubes. There's no way they're gonna vote for another challenge tomorrow. Look at how many people have gotten out. Every single one of these\nXs used to be a person. - There was a human right here. - There is no one around me. - I'm the youngest one here. - If I leave, I leave on a challenge. I'm not leaving walking out. - I have not come this far to give up. - I'm gonna let you guys say\nyour votes over the microphone. Do you want a challenge? - Absolutely. - Yes or no? - Yes.\n- Yes. - Challenge. - Yes or no? - Yes.\n- We're doing a challenge. - Mic drop.\n- Mic drop. - In our Squid Games video, you guys loved the marble\ngame, so we brought it back. Just like last time, the\ncontestants are playing one v. one against their neighbor. Each player's given ten marbles, and they choose what game to play. By the end of 30 minutes, only the person with 20 marbles moves on. These guys just wanted\nto get in over with. - This is a $500,000 coin flip. - Oh.\n- Oh. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm\nso sorry, it is heads. - First to two wins, right? It's up to you guys. Oh, my God, sunk it, that's one point. Oh. If you make it into any\nbucket, you win right here. - Let's go. - Oh, my God, he won it. - I'm sorry, buddy. - All good, all good. - Count 'em up. Make sure you have 20. - Got ten blue, nine red. - You're missing a marble? - Can you count again? - 19, you are one short. - I'm not holding onto any. - Interesting. There's only seven minutes left, so if you care for this\nman, you should find it. - Where is it? - You're currently at 18 marbles. And you're at two marbles. - I'm leaving this in your hands. - It's okay. - I'm so sorry. Oh, good. - Whoa. There might be a comeback. - It might be. - I found it. - Really? - Yeah.\n- Oh, really? - It was in my bed sheet. - He has one more marble. If you win with that one\nmarble, that'd be crazy. I thought that was in. - That's it.\n- Oh. - I can officially step out now. Oh, that feels so bad. - This keeps going back and forth. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Rock, paper, scissors. Hey, remember, you said we'd both go home, so one of us is gonna have\nto decide a different game. - Rock, paper, scissors for\nhalf a minute is bad too. - Okay, this is for all the marbles. We're gonna do all or nothing. Does that sound fair? - This is for all the marbles?\n- Yeah. - But you have 14 marbles and he has six. Why are you gambling? - All or nothing, a minute and a half. - Hurry up. - Rock, paper, scissors, turn! - I got 'em all. - 54 escaped elimination again. 30 seconds remain. - Okay, we're done to the last two. It was the same position as\nthis only a couple minutes ago. - And, the thing is, a\nminute ago it was me. - Is there anything you wanna\nsay to each other before this? - I love you.\n- I love you too. Let's just do this, right? - It's okay, congratulations. Can I hug her?\n- Yeah. - I lost to an amazing person. - It was rough. - The only people left are 23, 40, 43, 52, and 54. - Look at the graveyard of Xs. These were all cubes\nlike mine at the start. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous. - Things have been getting\na little more intense. - Today is my daughter's birthday. It's just hitting home now\nthat I'm not gonna be there. - Can you all hear me? - Yes. - When we started, there was a 100 of you, and now we're down to five. Do you wanna reduce it even\nfurther with a challenge? - Yes! - All right, but you guys chose this. In this challenge, the 95 contestants who have already left will vote. And the three of you with\nthe most votes are gone. - Wow. - I'm definitely worried\nabout this challenge. - Certain people here have kind of brushed people the wrong way. - You have no idea what\npeople think of you. - At this point, I'm rather glad that I didn't really make any enemies. - Do you think the people\nthat lost liked you? - For the most part. - Are you willing to bet\nhalf a million dollars that they liked you? - I don't know about that one. - Do you think the people that\nwere eliminated liked you? - No.\n- What's not to like? - Let's find out. We literally asked every single one of the\n95 eliminated people who they want gone. - Heart's about to jump outta my throat. - How many votes does it say you got, Joe? - Ten. - Which is not enough to be eliminated! He's one of the two that passed. Which means only one of\nthese four cubes remains. So, I'm bad with this stuff, do you wanna, you wanna handle it?\nYou got it. - 23.\n- Yes? - You were, in fact, eliminated. - No. To lose it in top five, when I've come as far, was super painful. - I really didn't expect 23 to go. - And, now, only one\nof these three remain. Do you think it's you? - I hope so. - That didn't sound confident. You received 15 votes. - Oh. - Oh, this is brutal. - Love you, Chris. - I'm not gonna lie, losing\nout on that was crushing. After spending, roughly, seven days here, and getting that close\nto that grand prize, and not getting it, it hurts. - And, now, the two of you. All right, we'll come over here. - This is tense. Very tense. - 54. - I got the most votes, I know. - Wait, how'd you know that? - I don't trust the\nman over there, at all. - You're done, big boy, done. - I just know. - Yeah, you did.\nYou got 37 votes. - So, I'm in?\n- Which means, 52, you passed! - I'm in! This was a once in a lifetime chance. - I've got a 50% chance at\nwinning half a million dollars. - As a reward for making\nit to the final two, I have one last surprise for you. What do you think it is? - Oh, I have no idea. - What is this right here? - That's for my daughter. - Today's her birthday? Well, let's see what comes\nthrough the curtains. - Don't do this to me. Oh, my God. - I'm not gonna let you miss her birthday. - Is that your daddy? - Regardless if you win or lose, we're proud of you, you can do this. - Good job! - This is the fam. - Hi! - I couldn't ask for anything else. That was my everything right there. - Yeah. I've got this now. - Only ages 52 and 40 remain, and they've been living in\nthese cubes for over a week. - Day eight. It's been a wild ride. - Here I am. I can't believe it. Every challenge I've\nsaid, I thought I was out. I thought I was out. I made it. - It's a lot more feasible now in my mind, because it's not me\nversus 98 other people. It's me versus one person. - All these Xs were\ncubes with people in 'em, and everybody's gone now,\nand it's just Joe and I. - Another day here is not\ngonna make somebody quit. To come down to something actually forcing one of us to leave. - I give them a chance to say no to a challenge, but- - Oh, my, what should we do? - I can't believe they chose a challenge. They are taking a half\na million dollar gamble. Inside one of these briefcases, is the check for $500,000. And everyone on set is blindfolded, including the cameramen,\nwhile I mix up the cases. I promise this will make\nsense in just a minute. The briefcases are now mixed. And, because you guys chose a challenge, you can step outta your\ncubes and meet in the middle. Half a million dollars is\nabout to go to 52 or 40. I'm going to flip a coin to decide who gets to look inside\nof their briefcase, making them the only person on set that knows where the money is. - It's a game of bluffery. - That's right, because, then, it's up to the other person to choose which briefcase they want to take home. Heads or tails? - Heads. - Tails. Whenever you're ready,\nlook inside your briefcase. I don't even want to know what's in there. I can't stand the burden. 52 now has to decide whether she's gonna keep her\nbriefcase or steal his. - Joe, do you have\n$500,000 in your briefcase? - Yes. - Joe, are you lying? - What do you think? - Was there anything\nelse in the briefcase, other than the money? - I saw the Mr. Beast logo. - You saw a check in there? - Yes. - Joe, are you honest? - You spent enough time\nwith me, what do you think? - This is so nerve wracking. Half a million dollars on the line. Is she going to keep her\nbriefcase or take his? - Wow. - It's a big decision. - What do you think, as of\nright now, in your head? Do you think it's in there? - I don't think it's in there. I think I have it. - I'm so nervous. - I'm, actually, my heart is beating. I'm actually feeling anxious for you guys. - And you swear that the\nmoney is in your case? - Yes. - I don't think it's in there. I think I'm gonna pick my case. - So, you're gonna keep this? - Locked in? - All right, Joe, what\nis inside your briefcase? Oh, my God! - I knew it!\n- Yeah! - And you told her it was in there. - I did. - This man literally said he had it. Oh, my gosh, what a crazy play. What is wrong with you? - He told the truth, and he got it. We said all along, the good guys can win. - It pays off to be honest. Even though you didn't win, we still wanna give you $10,000, and your family a trip to Disneyland to make losing a little better. They're still gonna go. - Yay! - We took items from the set and turned them into collectible pieces that we are selling for only one penny. And you have to act quickly, because there's only a\nlimited amount of 'em, and they're gonna sell out fast. Click the link below and\ndownload the Shop app right now.

youtube warehouse well actually we're currently inside of it and i want to show you guys around so he can get views we're going to show you where his videos are filmed how his videos are edited and then finally how much a ridiculous setup like this actually costs and i'm a little scared because i've never shown anyone around this studio this is gonna be a first time this is gonna be cool come in here is around 50 000 square feet there's no polls or anything so we can just build sets we can do whatever we want you know what's blowing my mind this is not what i associate with youtube you know what's funny that's literally what everyone says when they come in here they're like for youtube one thing i noticed immediately when i walked in is like you clap you hear nothing back yeah except these guys in the back yeah they're working on a video that's exactly right so we soundproof the ceiling on top of that uh you'll probably notice there's hundreds of sprinklers on the ceiling do you have sprinklers because you keep blowing stuff up in here yeah exactly no you could blow up a car there and not have to worry about burning them in the building that's a rare use case scenario in one of our coming up video we need a million dollars these are empty don't try to rob me right now so we're putting ten thousand dollars in a hundred briefcases is there a reason you've settled on this particular model of briefcase does this just not look like ten thousand dollars i don't know it could be maybe more golden [Laughter] okay time to ask jimmy the big question android or iphone obviously iphone steve jobs steve jobs name the person who created android andy rubin okay well i didn't know that we'll keep a tally of every single person we meet in this tour this right here is one of our coming up videos the beauty of having all this space is our old warehouse was basically the size of this room this room feels like there was some havoc yeah there's a lot of havoc there's just like random broken bits of tech and eggs yeah so you should remember that if you show anything bad i'm gonna get egged that was a threat oh you're gonna break tech in front of me yeah yeah i will this was our little hub over here that you would have thought was baller so this is what it looked like when we were filming so you could see all the girls cameras there all the boys cameras there so we could constantly monitor it this is the kind of stuff we don't normally show we had to have six or seven people here monitoring every angle because if they just touch the red line they're out you have to basically set up like 40 cameras so you can monitor every single inch of the line what they're doing on top of content and there's two of them it's a role you don't think about yeah what did you do today i stared at girls for a hundred hours like you might want to refreeze i stared at a red line for a hundred dollars someone's getting a little edgy over here yeah and on top of that you can zoom in as well so we have tons of shots but just zooming into their mouths or whatever they're eating food oh my god like what kind of zoom level do you want to go to the camera room yeah okay james he's curious do you use iphone or android oh two to zero two zeros steve jobs wrapped around the studio is tons of office space multiple floors you'll just see like these are some people planning our next video is that room called boobs i didn't do it all right so this is the camera room yes some videos we use 100 cameras some videos we use 10 some we need to be able to zoom in 100x something we need a hundred vlog cameras for hide and seek there's a lot of weird things in here you want to summon tariq by some of them you're summoning them hey what's up this transition is going to suck this is tariq he's had a camera hello he's going to show us what's going on here i've never seen so much camera gear in my entire life we have 26 fs5s these are the time-lapse cameras that you guys see so every time you see a time-lapse shot this camera is usually hanging somewhere on set capturing it okay what just to give you guys an idea the fs5 was a six thousand dollar camera when it was launched in 2015. these guys have 26 of them five kids 26. let's do the math yeah the total is a lot and then you've got loads of the same lens so the way it works is every single camera lens has a focal length which basically just indicates how zoomed in it is our videos relative to these are very homegrown we film most of them in my bedroom the widest angle we have is like 24 mil and the most telescopic one we have is like a 55mm but these guys when they go wide they go wide this is a 10 millimeter lens which is used to capture the entirety of a massive video set in one shot and then when they want to get close-ups from further away they have a lens here capable of not 50 millimeters or 80 millimeters but 300 millimeters this is a telescope but there's three more key cameras that the mysteries team uses the first being the sony 4k camcorder so we usually use these for run and gun videos slash when we have a lot of night time shots and that's because it has not just actual night vision but also just insane optical image stabilization look how much the lens moves on the inside and then to top it all off there's about 50 gopro cameras in these boxes here and another 50 of what are effectively super high-end security cameras each capable of streaming a live view of their feed so that people in that control center can keep an eye on the video contestants in real time oh and also they have 20 times optical zoom and then the pista resistance this is an fvv drone that looks like you've made it we have an fpv pilot you build this you built it yeah it's actually wild that's something that someone has built themselves is a big part of your filming gear i'm putting you on the spot here all right can you guess the total value of tech in this room i'm about to be so wrong 1.3 million sweet it's been great thank you so much man oh and thank god i'm back tariq sucks i won't leave again i kind of missed you jimmy oh my gosh we're missing a lot of our play buttons we do our videos in tons of languages this is just our english channels this is mr b6 000 so what point did you change it in between 100k and a million apparently but anyways this is missing a lot don't look at it it's ugly do you have iphone or android i don't know which one i have android are you using oh wait so that's one for android one for android you use iphone well i guess a point for both it's 2022 and if you're still buying white boards you are an idiot there's a thing called whiteboard paint you can just draw wherever it doesn't matter it comes off so for us any note that we make we make it a thing to keep it digital you want to keep it online so that anyone can kind of log in and check it do you guys not care about that no no we're wall drawers i grab a water no he took it anyways this is an enormous screen when we got this place someone was like yeah we got free tvs and that was all i was told i don't even shout out to sony get your marketing budget on this it turns out jimmy's free tvs that you find all around this building they're actually sony's new 85-inch 8k hdr smart tvs and they're being used to watch 1080p content fantastic very comfortable that's an ipad holder yeah but does anyone actually use this you tell me and while he's getting comfortable we're going to continue the tour we don't need them what is this for like in the middle of a meeting is someone just going to be like sorry guys hey we're doing a tour i don't mind wait it's too comfortable no no it doesn't what i can't get in were you struggling to get inside that room all you gotta do is just that it picks up the bluetooth on my phone and it recognizes it's me so i can unlock the door so yeah this is my little apartment this is where i live for the most part so you actually sleep in your office of course this is my bed looks like my girlfriend left me a message yes if you want to sleep in my bed i won't stop you okay this is nice okay so in jimmy's fridge yogurt and water what we're potentially launching our own sauce at cheeseburger blur what's on it so they don't get the ingredients the only thing you have to eat them with is yogurt the worst part of my tiny apartment is uh the fridge blocks the tv i'm running out of room i missed that this is an enormous screen but it's above the couch so i don't use it these are all my clothes over here bathroom talk oh really even my bathroom's not off limits bro really we're about to just film the bathroom together so this is a heated toilet seat i'm telling you it will change your life get a heated toilet seat it will make your butt feel great josh yeah he's getting b-roll with my toilet this is kind of my morning routine i get out of bed i walk over here work out and i walk over here i shower and i walk over here i change and i walk over here and i eat it's like a little morning circuit and then i walk out there and i work and right over here is one of the cool rooms we also have a gaming channel and a react channel which we film in here iphone or android on three hold up what phone you use okay it's three well you have two why they're both iphones let's go nevermind good anyways we're actually here to show them the react set so come on in over here so this is where we film all our reacts videos let's react to some tech content let's see it you got to see the best tech video of all time is this like 360 camera wait josh what's going on here we go to video two no it just looks like it was rendered weird was this supposed to happen what is going on is that your cat's bum that's milo nice to meet you milo's butthole oh i know this video this is one of my favorite visions of the future these calendars here oh my gosh you can walk up to it like that so it knows what part of the room you are i love this idea this digital overlay on the real world i do too honestly i'm kind of pissed off we don't already have this could you see yourself using like all this kind of stuff 100 i mean i don't know how to ride a bike so not this i'm just thinking about like pokemon go too oh all right now we're on to our next clip with tesla there's no elon i'm disliking this is some very brave piloting yeah oh my gosh isn't it a tesla the safest car ever made in history remember it survived a crash test and actually broke the crash test dummy do you see teslas as like an art form i just like obviously that they don't run on fossil fuels faster than other cars it has more like amenities but i don't really use any of that the biggest pull to me for tesla is the interior like you sit down you feel like you're being of course if you're a car guy i'm just not who's this guy oh this i need yeah that looks very cool you like sushi right i do no screw this frick roll i don't care that was actually genius i'm calling someone to order them i know you were trying to prank us but i don't care wait i'm buying them hey i need some uh auto stick chopsticks love you you don't probably get much experience with android vents never this is the xiaomi 12s ultra one of its big selling points is the fact that it has the biggest camera sensor and a phone wow this is cool yeah this is crazy love it yeah the coloring's good look at that tell me that doesn't look like a wallpaper i can't say it's better but i can tell you it's how it works it's an interesting take because normally iphone users just kind of shut down android phones and for coming out to beast react studio you get a giant lot of money here you go thanks for coming out all right let's continue the tour android or iphone yes two more android points i hate you guys and this room over here i think you guys will enjoy so it's top secret but i'll let you in right in the back corner of the building of all the rooms in the building i feel like you would appreciate this the most all right so this is the mrb server room the way these guys have set it up is that all the projects that they're ever working on are stored right here on site in this server which means that every single computer in this entire complex is accessing the same set of files at the same time but the cherry on top is that it's configured so that even if you're sitting on the other side of the world you can actually remotely log in and access the editing machines here to use them to edit footage that's stored right here in this server so how much storage would you say you have in this room infinite what do you think the total cost of this room is 400 grand do you use android or iphone you play chess i do play chess on a game of chess now over the few days that i spent with jimmy the one key thing that i've learned about this guy is he takes board games seriously he absolutely came to me in a game of katan the night before chess was my way of making sure i won one back oh my god that was a girl game all right so this is the editing room and i had two things that i wanted to find out here one how fast is mr beast internet oh i see you know what i mean yeah what what upload this you know with footage finding stuff and two if these guys have any special gear to edit with yeah they kind of do the editors who prefer windows they'll be choosing 19 000 hp workstations with 24 core server grade processors and 256 gigabytes of ram and for those who prefer mac a pretty equivalent expect one thousand dollar mac pro wait that's how much they cost yeah feels like we've been in a lot of rooms but this is only part of it there's so many rooms in this building and it's so massive that's what i love about it i feel like i'm getting my steps in and over here is the little kitchen there's festival bars over here you should be eating this it's a very colorful selection of beverages you've never seen unicorn magic honeydew soda it was in there because it was a punishment for a video we don't obviously drink this it's actually really nice yeah so much sugar that i'm literally tearing up so i have an editing question for you actually you've got the most ridiculous camera gear available to you you've got 300 cameras in some videos you just upgraded your cameras actually to new ones that can shoot 8k resolution which i never will because i think it looks too professional yeah so this is the question why is it that after all that you still export in 1080p i don't like the way high quality footage looks you know at the end of the day it's just me and the boys messing around you know we still come up with the videos it's still things that i find fun and i enjoy and i don't ever want things to feel too produced why do you do 8k we do 4k to some extent in the tech genre there's like an expectation that you have good production value of course if i can't take good footage who am i to judge other phones for how good they listen 4k this is in 4k okay but there's a twist here you've come here thinking that jimmy has just one studio he actually has two we've just seen what they call studio c okay and this is studio a this is where it all began this is also where i've heard a lot of mystery secrets are and this is walt hi i'm walt i'm the head of on-site production for mr b's gaming and mr beast reacts there's a whole bunch of lights here yep what lights does mr beast use for his videos they're called sky panels every single one is a seven thousand dollar fixture i'm capable of lighting an entire warehouse on its own honestly that's like at least 10 12 kilos probably [Laughter] now because studio c is becoming the main office that everyone works out of studio a is the one where you find the most exotic items i'm talking like a mini drivable lamborghini giant fake marshmallows from when they tried to recreate willy wonka's chocolate factory and then tubs upon tubs of costumes that they used in their recreation of the squid games so this is the gaming trailer oh yeah iphone or android i am iphone i got a 12 pro max this cabin which is a part of studio a is where the entirety of the mr beast gaming channel is filmed and it's kind of nerd paradise the shelves upon shelves of wonderful and questionable tech items there's a real ice cream machine and there's nerf guns everywhere but then we go deeper inside so this is the office where i kind of currently work out of is this what i think it is yeah it was the retro future the custom made original game boy wow the logo the sesame seeds the pink power button you can change the color on the screen it has that authentic that is wild you can't beat it weirdly that's one of the coolest pieces of tech i've seen so far here we have jimmy's gaming room the main idea with these setups is that they could sit down and then be good to go filming within a minute or two i'm gonna sit down and i'm gonna rate mr b's gaming setup oh good choice of chair you can tell that the entire setup here is just geared around efficiency they've got it to the point that with one tap of this button here all lights can be turned on and off and with the top of this button all the relevant programs that they need to film one of these gaming videos they are loaded and ready in one go including the software to be able to see your own camera view in real time the mouse is really smooth this is the most responsive windows experience i've ever had the keyboard is a membrane keyboard which is normally considered like a tier below but you've done that for noise really yeah intentionally and so given that it's actually actually really nice to type on it doesn't feel bad the keys have nice travel he's done a definite solid with this controller this is my favorite looking xbox controller ever the chrome outlines around each button are nice this is a very good choice of mic and if you're wondering what the pc is that mr beast uses for gaming with an i9 11 900k 32 gigs of ram and an rtx 3090 graphics card hooked up to a 4k 120hz monitor this whole setup would be around 15 000 but that's not the crazy part because there isn't just one of them the entire room has actually been almost 100 cloned four times one for each of the characters in jimmy's videos chandler carl and chris they all have slightly different chairs and keyboards based on their preferences but the core machines behind it are one-to-one so this is the storage worker this is the storage of our house i've been told this is the weirdest place yes you need giant 40-inch touchscreen iphones got those yeah so as you can tell i'm very heavily on to team iphone so this giant iphone it's essentially a real iphone 6s that's casting its screen to an apple tv box screwed into the back that's hooked up to a large tv screen it sounds ridiculous but it works this is wild this is like the one part of it that i i wouldn't have thought actually works yeah i could take a portrait mode all right let's do that yeah i got it i got you i got you there we go there you go left my mark this storage center is just rammed with all the stuff that's been used in past videos that might need to be used in future videos literally anything you can think of tiki torches rubber chickens an even bigger nano leaf light collection then we have even a box full of shockingly realistic babies don't ask me why it's here pretty much all the expensive stuff lies within here as far as like phones to give away it's always apple i think you're just broken i'll scare you a little bit i'm sorry and to wrap up the studio tour i wanted to show him something cool so walk with me boys oh there's a plant there we're doing a video where i put a guy inside of this red circle see that outline around the house and if he survives in there for 100 days straight he wins half a million dollars okay so we've seen studio c we've seen studio a we've seen whatever this is we've got the full price of all the tech inside what is the actual cost of the buildings themselves oh boy the big studio over there was a little over 10 million dollars the old one actually was a church that we renovated that was like probably 1.3 million so okay 11.3 million dollars in buildings yeah everything i don't even want to know the total you know what i just make the best videos possible and sometimes i have to spend money and if you enjoyed this video then a sub to the channel would be he told me to say beastly you might have noticed over the last few months that the entire way that i'm trying to make my videos is changing the way i spend much more time moving between locations and being out and about the way i'm trying to get more interactions with youtube friends and members of the public and how i'm trying to have a clear golden moment in every video a culmination of everything that rewards you the viewer for clicking a lot of this stuff has come from the storytelling through film course that i found on skillshare by a guy called thomas de gea and the thing that really struck me about this is how efficiently you can learn stuff on this platform there's no clickbait there's no ads and it's organized in such a way that you can pick up any new skill in practically any category from animation to marketing start to finish in 30 minutes the first thousand of you to sign up using my code or

prize of $800,000 fo", "transcript": " I have built the most\ndeadly obstacle course in the world, and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it\nwithout falling 200 feet to the ground. Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man.", "timestamp": "2024-06-18 13:08:31"}, {"video_id": "PWirijQkH4M&t", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWirijQkH4M&t=5s", "summary": "**Obstacle Course Summary**\n\nMack attempts six obstacle courses for a chance to win $800,000. Each course tests his strength, balance, intelligence, a", "transcript": " I have built the most\ndeadly obstacle course in the world, and my friend Mack here is attempting to complete it\nwithout falling 200 feet to the ground. Whenever you're ready, Mack. First jump, he's about to do it. Oh my God, I'm so high up in the air. Look at how much\nthat platform is shaking. We are currently hundreds of feet\nin the air. Look at that. And this is just\nthe first of many deadly, painful, absolutely insane obstacle courses\nMack will face in this video. And if Mack completes all six of the\nobstacle courses coming up. He wins $800,000. That looks insane. I could not do what he's doing right now. Oh my God, that thing almost touched me. He might not even make it past\nthe first level. Two more jumps. Oh my God. This is the last jump. I don't know if I\ncan jump that far. And of course, I have to make it\nthe hardest jump. There's double swinging hammers \nand it's the longest distance. You have this. I don't know if I have it. Mack, 800 grand's on the line. This is going to be a short video, boys. It's scary for me and \nI'm on the stable platform. Yes! Yeah! Don't celebrate too early. That was the easiest \nof the six obstacle courses. Let's go to the next one. Can't get harder than that. Actually, yes it can. Mack has to complete \nall six obstacle courses if he wants to walk away\nwith $800,000. Mack, are you ready? I don't know. The answer is no, because we're not\nhundreds of feet in the air yet. We're going up...? Welcome to level two. As I said before,\nthis one is much harder. Remove your blindfold. In front of you are two games\nyou used to play as a child. Balance beam and monkey bars. You just have to pick one of those\nand get to this side. Also take your harness off. No, no, no, no. If for whatever reason he fails\nthis obstacle course, he free falls 100 feet into a net,\njust like the first course. and his 800 grand will burn. Jimmy, you gotta chill out, bro. - This is the second one.\n- What do you mean? Winning\n$800,000 isn't supposed to be easy. God, dude. All right, it looks like he's\nchoosing monkey bars. This is scary to watch him\nclimb down. Once he starts dangling on that\nfirst bar, he can't go back. Let's see if he locks \nin the monkey bars. No way. 800 grand on the line. Three. Don't look down. There's no going back. Two. Oh my gosh! Come on Mack! Oh, don't fall Please don't fall. \nPlease don't fall. You got it! Bro, this is crazy. I know it might be hard, but look, money. Money's over here. Keep going. Oh, this one's way further. Well, Mark, the further\nyou go, the harder it gets. Oh, no. Oh my God. Mack, you're almost halfway already. Think of all the other times\nyou lost. Don't do that to yourself. Mack, if you fall, \nwe have to get a new contestant. Oh my gosh. All right, just a couple more. All right.\nThis one's a big one. It's a big one. He's right here. Oh, this is a crazy shot. Please don't fall. \nHe's so close. Oh, my gosh! If you're wondering who \nmy psychotic friend Mack is, he's actually a contestant \nfrom two previous challenge videos. Even though he tragically lost\nboth of them. He's been a massive crowd favorite,\nso I'm giving him one final chance to redeem himself\nand win this money once and for all. Welcome to level three. What is this Jimmy? Potentially your worst nightmare. You see, so far in this video,\nthe obstacle courses have all been about strength,\nwhich you're pretty good at. But this level is going to test\nyour brain. Press and hold this red button. Okay. As you will see, a pattern\nis now popping up on the floor. Wait for this pattern to populate. To move on, \nyou'll need to cross this floor. Only stepping on the green tiles. And let go of the button. The catch is you'll be doing it\ncompletely from memory. You have exactly 30 minutes\nto memorize the 44 tile pattern perfectly, and if you accidentally\nstep on one red square, your money is rigged to explode. Here's a riot shield. Oh my gosh! It'll protect you from the bomb. Start the timer. Go for it. And he's off. The rain makes this so much more dramatic. Okay, the first step. Oh. Stop. Don\u2019t! Tell us before you go. I do not need that. - That is not helpful to me.\n- I didn't have my riot shield up. Mack, you sure you don't want to come back? No, I... Bro, you can press the button \nas much as you want. If you're not confident in your next step,\nyou should really. Don't blow up your money. Almost five minutes\nhave gone by. - I don't need that.\n- And you're still at the start. I don't need that. Mack, you've basically done \na tile a minute so far. Okay, thanks Karl. - And there's more than 30 tiles.\n- Okay. All right, here we go. - Okay. \n- How confident are you? - Not \n- That that won't explode the money? I'm not confident. - Okay. \n- And you're going to do it anyways? I'm kind of confident. He's getting deranged. 23 minutes left. As you're questioning\nwhether or not to take that step. I want to remind you,\nthis is your final chance to win this 800 grand. If you lose again,\nwe're not bringing you back. Is it the forward one or \nwhat do you think? Who are you asking Mack? - Jimmy, I don't know.\n- You want me to help you win my money? It's not worth it. It's not worth it. At this point, Mack was navigating\nso far into the course that an individual attempt was\ncosting him at least six minutes, no matter what he tried. He continued to forget\nthe very end of the pattern. It was down 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, boom. I think this is it. All right. \nThis is uncharted territory. I haven't gone this far. You have nine minutes. You can go back and check\nif you want. I thought that was it. The only way I could go\nfrom here is forward. I think it's... - Mack?\n- Yes. Remember how you felt\nwhen you lost the 700 grand and 800 grand? Frequently, I think about that. So for your sanity, you might want to go\npress the button one more time. But it's up to you. Oh, you're going back. This is going to be my last time. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Four. Four. Right. Two. Four. Four.\nRight two. Mack spent half his remaining time repeating the pattern over\nand over again, hoping that his decision to return to the start\none last time wasn't for nothing. But when Mack was finally confident\nenough to give it his last attempt. - Right, two. Okay, this is it.\n- All right. He was faced with an extremely tight\ndeadline. Under four minutes remain. Under four... Oh my God. Mack, I think it's time. Mute everybody out, bro. \nIt's just you. - Godspeed. \n- It's you and the tiles. I can literally feel my heart \npounding right now. This is so intense. He had 30 minutes to do this. There is now less than three minutes. One wrong step\nand he loses another 800 grand. Four. Four. Okay Four. Four. This way. One. Two. Three. This is where he got stuck last time. Oh my God. Dude, it's coming down to the wire. I still got time. I still got time. Oh, there's a high probability\nof an explosion coming up. All right, Mack, there's 10 seconds left. Wait, I don't know. All right, all right. - Okay! You can just jump!\n- Just jump. Jump, jump. There\u2019s no time! 3! 2! Jump! You did it! Yeah. Oh God I'm so happy he's not picking me up. Oh you're right. \nCome here, come here buddy. No. I'm being assaulted. And if Mack did step on a red tile. Anyways,\nlet's head over to level four. Come on. Now, this next level\nmay look friendly, but I know for a fact\nit's going to obliterate you. This... ... is level four. And even though this course\nisn't in the sky, the obstacles you see here... That's a lot ...are almost impossible to accomplish \nin your one and only attempt. So therefore\nyou have two options. Tell me. You can attempt to do this\nmonster of an obstacle course, and if you fall in the water,\nlose everything. Or you can hold my Feastables chocolate bar and as long as you don't drop it,\nget as many attempts as you want. Feastables sounds like the plan. Just don't let go that bar\nwhen you hit the water. What could go wrong? Oh, He literally would have lost\nin the first two steps. So it's a good thing he's holding on\nto the greatest chocolate on earth. Yeah, we're going to be here all night.\nBut I don't want to be. So it's about dang time \nhe got through the log roll. I just remembered, you're\nsupposed to be wearing this helmet. Even though you\ndon't need a helmet to know that Feastables\nis the best chocolate, I need you to wear one so you don't\ndie holding my product on camera. Whatever you do, don't drop \nthat Feastables chocolate bar that's available\nin every single Walmart nationwide. You can also buy Feastables using \nYouTube shopping at the link below. What is this? There's only one way to find out.\nGive it a try. It does not feel possible. Bro, that gap is insane. What is going on? Mack, you want to get onto it. Oh, okay. - Yeah. \n-  Genius. Yeah Mack. Mack seems to be struggling, \nso I'm going to show him how it's done. This is how it's done, Mack. Did you know that Feastables chocolate comes in seven different flavors? Like my favorite one, almond. Jimmy I'm probably going to be joining you \ndown there in a second. He did it. I love Feastables chocolate. I'm definitely not taking a break\nright now to catch air. Mack, the only thing standing between\nyou and level five are these not big red balls. I called them that, \nso Wipeout wouldn't sue me. And these balls are so much harder\nthan the rest of this level that we brought some other creators\nto test them out. And let's just say\nthey didn't do too hot. I'm never gonna die. Disregard everything he just did. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. So if you don't want your trilogy\nto end with balls, you better hold on to that Feastables bar. - Good luck. \n- Three. Two. One. God. All right. Try two. Try three. Try four. Yes! No! For literally hours. Mack just fell and fell. Oh, yeah. And then he fell. We're going to be here until \nabout four days from now. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't grab on to that\nthird ball. We've been going so long\nthat the sun is literally starting to come up. This is your legacy. You got it. Yes. Yes. It literally took him\nthree hours to get on that ball. Hold on! \nDon't drop that bar. I'm not dropping the bar. He did it. Press the button before you drop the bar. Let's go. Oh my gosh! Yeah! Well... You only have two more obstacle\ncourses to finally win one of these videos. It's not getting harder than that. You can't lie to a man\nwhile you shake their hand. Exactly. Which we're doing. That totally was the hardest one. Just kidding. Mack is screwed. This next one is way harder. \nRight this way, Mack. - Watch out! Watch your step. \n- What? Where are we going? Yeah. Forward! - I can't see. \n- Take the blindfold off. Welcome to level five. What? What is this? What's.\nWhat's going on? This level, you could probably tell \nwe just built. You see? Balance has been a trouble for you\nin past videos. You even declined the balance beam\nearlier in this video. You weren't even able to get over one rolling log without falling\nand six times in a row. So now you'll have to cross not one,\nbut three rolling logs and get all eight\nbags of money to the other side. And if you fall once, just once,\nyou lose everything. And before you do this challenge,\nI left out one final thing. You mind pulling this lever? What's going to happen when\nI pull the lever? Just pull the lever. - There's no way.\n- We're doing this challenge... - No! no, no, no!\n- 200 feet up in the sky. Why? It was perfectly fine. Not the sky. The feeling of the ground just \ndisappearing like that. I'm not gonna lie.\nI'm kind of scared. This is wild. You will be not human\nif you weren't scared of it. Oh my gosh. We\u2019re so high up! You okay Mack? No. What's wrong? I feel like I'm about to\nlose all this again, dude. I'm... Just don't fall. This exact thing. I couldn't even get across\non the Wipeout course. I fell off of it like five times. And now there's three of them,\nand we're 200 feet in the sky. In case I do fall. Thank you for giving me a third\nchance.  I don't know if I've ever actually said \nthank you for giving me a third chance. No, you just yelled at me a bunch. Yeah, I know. \nWell, you put me in the sky. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. This is very sweet,\nbut I have a feeling you're just stalling\nbecause you're afraid. Yeah. Mack has lost $1.5 million. Let's see if it becomes 2.3 million. Whenever you're ready. There's only one thing I say \nin situations like this over and over again. Godspeed. When he walks, the entire platform shakes. There it is.\nThere it is. I'm going to go for it. \nRight there, watch out. Yes! And the final piece\nof the challenge that I haven't told Mack\nis as long as you've made it across. You're free to move\non to the final obstacle course with whatever\nmoney you brought. Or if you're feeling risky,\nyou can come back for more. He didn't see that coming. This is a good bit. What do you think I should do? No, bro, you go for it. You just did this. You first tried both bags.\nAre you kidding me? You're coming\nback at 600 grand or not? In the wise words of Karl. But you're doing this on your own\naccord. and if you fail, it's not... No, I'm doing it because Karl told me to. Karl Jacob's a celebrity. There he is. Oh, my God. Oh, perfect. He has now made one full trip. I'm going to either sleep\nwith a smile on my face tonight, or I won't sleep for three. Let's go. And while Mack is hundreds of feet\nin the air risking 800 grand. I want to tell you about Cirkul. The best part about Cirkul \nis these flavor cartridges which you just screw one \non the top like this, which allows you to make your water\ntastes like whatever you want. You can also adjust the flavor\nintensity just by turning this dial. So if you set it to three,\nyou'll get a little bit of flavor. But Karl set it to nine now. Jimmy, that's a lot of flavor. That's a ton of flavor, which\nmakes it easier to drink more water. I have an idea. \nKarl! Oh. That's it. I can't believe he's\nactually them. - That's four.\n- I can't believe that worked. Dude, I just wish\nthat there was new colored bottles. Cirkul actually has \nfive new colored bottles available now. Okay. Welcome back. See you. \nIf you want to give Cirkul a try, just go to your local Walmart\nright now because I convinced Cirkul to give their biggest drop ever\nfor a limited time. All right, Karl, \nare you ready to send it again? Take your time. I can't believe he's throwing\nthese hundreds of feet in the air. Every one of these\nthrows is literally 100 grand. Good stuff, man. - Ready to finish it out?\n- Let's do this. Do you want to just\nstay over there and move on? Or do you want to come back here? This is where things get risky. You can go over there with Karl and move on competing \nfor only 600 K Or once again, grab the last\n$200,000 and risk it all. Dude, you got this. All right. That's the Mack I know. Okay. God dang it, dude. You made it across.\nWhy are you mad? Because I almost didn't\nmake it across. He's back. Bring on the money, baby. All right, let's bring it home. No hesitation. Godspeed. And he's off.\nHe's off. Take a second, bro.\nYou're good. This is a routine now. Yes. - You ready to do this?\n- Oh, yeah. - Let's bring it home, huh?\n- Yeah, dude. Think about your\nlegs. Don't fall. All right. Okay. I'm coming to you. \nAll right? Okay. All the money's on the other side. Now he just has to cross\nwithout falling. Three. Two. One. He did it. Oh my God! Oh my God. \nOh my God. Come on. You thought I was done? We're not done yet, baby. Come on! Don't celebrate yet. The last challenge is\nwhere you always lose. I'm not messing this up again. And now it's time\nfor the final challenge. Once again, Mack is blindfolded. But you can probably tell\nby the noise. We are going back up. We are now at the top. A couple more steps.\nA couple more steps. Take off your blindfold. Witness the final challenge. This is by far the most insane obstacle course\nin this entire video. Oh, man. Dude, that is that is. That is crazy. I wouldn't blame you\nif you're terrified at this course. And because you've been through a lot and not only this video,\nbut past videos including spiders, drowning, boulders, lasers,\nand of course, cookies. I have one out for you. You look right here. You don't even know \nwhat I'm going to say yet. I know exactly\nwhat you're going to say. I'm not doing that thing. In here is an umbrella cookie. So I'm going to give you a choice. You can attempt this umbrella cookie and if you complete it\nwith 800 grand. Or attempt this giant, monstrosity, physics defying obstacle course. And if you complete that, win 800 grand. This is a massive decision. - Here's the cookie. \n- I'm not accepting it. At least not yet. I've had actual, legitimate\nnightmares about this cookie. Oh, What was that, like a wop-wop ah? Kind of, that's sad. But I guess, I mean, \nyou did lose $1.5 million to it. And if you lose right now, $2.3 million and no other \nattempts in the future. He just threw it. Now that I know that. All right, we won't be needing\nthis bad boy. There is no turning back. Every single challenge\nin every video. All boils down to this moment right now. Let's get it. To kick it off he has these \ntwo trapeze bars and then a yellow platform. This only ends by you finishing or you falling. This is gonna be crazy. All right, we're off. He did it! That's only going to get easier,\nright? Yeah. Just don't look down. He looked down right when I said that. Here we go. That is insane. By the way, Mack, did I tell you\nI brought your mom and dad out? They're down there\nwatching right now. - Go Mack.\n- Come on Mack. Mack, you can do this. Oh my God. Oh, God. - Yes, yes.\n- Mack! This next contraption\nis what I call the Wall of Death. Creative name. Oh, boy. This one has a little bit\nof strategy. He can go up and down, or he can\njust come straight across right there. And in case you forgot,\nput the camera down. We're still 200 feet in the air. Oh my God. This is insane. Don't take your hand off. That's freaking me out. Freaking you out? My hands are sweating\njust watching. Oh, I feel sick. This makes me want to throw up. God, this handles are so small. Almost there. Yes! - Mom, are you okay? \n- Yes. My arms are so tired. Well, lucky for you, you still have, like, a quarter\nof a football field left, and you're going to need your\nstrength for all of the remaining levels. This one is all about when you \ndismount the circle. Basically,\nif you let go too early, you fall. Mack, you're shaking your arms out a lot. You better save your strength. You know how it works. The hardest is still yet to come. Yes! Yes! Now the giant swinging hammers. These things are massive. And I see you brought my friend\nthe balance beam back. If he gets hit, there's\nno shot he's... - What are you doing?\n- What does it look like I'm doing? Watch your head. Oh my God. That\u2019s gotta be terrifying. Yeah, Mack. Yeah! You're now at the final part of level six. Now, listen, I know earlier\nyou chose not to attempt the cookie. However, considering the history\nyou have with these cookies, I just couldn't resist\nbringing them back one last time. I thought you already brought them back. Why are you bringing it back twice? \nThere's no need for that. I knew you were going to say no to that. Anyone with a brain says no to that. - How do I get to that? \n- You just jump, How else did you get there? And with every jump They get further and further apart. And if that wasn't hard enough,\nI made sure that each cookie gets exponentially smaller\nby the jump. And the only thing between\neach of them is a trapeze bar. and 200 feet of untethered free fall. - You got this Mack. \n- You got it. Four jumps. Let's see if Mack gets rich. Three. Two. One. Oh God. It was almost over right there. That was terrifying. One down, three more to go. And Mack\nalmost lost on the biggest cookie. Remember, the cookies get smaller\nwith every jump. Don't let this be the moment\nwhere you repeat history. Because it's\ngoing to be your final fall. As you can see, this bar is outside\nof Mack's reach, so he has to jump. And if he misses it midair, it's\nover and you go home with nothing... One. ...but shame Okay. He's swinging a lot. Don't swing for too long, Mack. You're gonna need to save\nyour strength for the umbrella. - Yes.\n- Mack! Yes! There's some more. Does the crack of the star\nremind you of anything? You're in the endgame now, Mack. These two cookies have broken you just as much as you have\nbroken them. Fail here and the chance to be lifted \nfrom the darkness, will be gone forever. Godspeed. He's off. - Yeah!\n- Yes! - Go Mack.\n- Go Mack. All right, we're on the final jump. Twice as far as the previous jump. Arguably the biggest hurdle\nin Mack's entire life. The umbrella. It's do or die. \nHe's either going to win 800 grand Or the saga ends\n and this all was for nothing. Your family's rooting for you. Everyone at home is rooting for you Three. I can't breathe. Two. One. I think... Oh, he's about to jump.\nHe jumped Oh my gosh. He's so far away from that cookie. - I can't watch this.\n- I can't breathe. Just so you know,\nthere's 60s left, man. Wait.\nWhat just happened? Oh, no. I actually don't know what to say. I'm such an idiot, dude. Oh my God. I did that twice? - Yes!\n- Yeah! Yeah! - You did it. \n- Yeah. After three tries.\nYou finally did it. For the first time he is holding \nthe money that he has won. - Yes! \n- Yeah. What are you gonna spend\nthe $800,000 on? I've got three friends of mine, \nchildhood friends of mine. They don't have a lot of money. I'm gonna make sure they don't worry\nabout money anymore. I mean, my life's changed now. Congrats man. \nYou deserve it. It's changed forever, bro. You deserve it. Dude, thank you. \nThank you so much. Yes! Dude! Dude! Yes! Yes! Look at how happy they are. Oh, I love you guys. Mack, Mack. \nOh my God! I did it mom. \nThank you! Good job, man. I've never been so happy to lose $800,000. Congrats man.", "timestamp": "2024-06-18 13:20:46"}]}
